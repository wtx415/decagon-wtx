Learn where your audience is finding (or not finding) answers to their questions, and determine how long it\u2019s currently taking them to do so. Your goal throughout this project will be to reduce that time spent searching.\nFind your documentation and create a content map for future state \u2014 Next, dive into your docs. What questions can be answered with current documentation? Do you need to write new docs? Update old ones? Write this all down, you\u2019ll come back to it later on.\nSet a measurable ROI goal \u2014 At this point, we hope you have a sense of the pain points in your current workflows.

If your databases aren\u2019t feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.\nThings that can slow your database down\nNumber of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.\nNumber of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.\nComplex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.",
            "Things you can do to speed up your database setup\nAvoid building too many databases into high-traffic pages\nIf you have a large workspace, avoid having lots of inline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.\nTry housing each database in its own page first. Once you\u2019ve done that, if you\u2019d like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:\nType /linked in that page and select Linked view of a database to create a linked database.\nCreate database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!",
            "When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.\nAvoid complex reference chains\nFormulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.\nMinimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups\nDatabases that are filtered and sorted on formula and rollup properties may take a bit longer to load.\nFilter on simple properties",
            "Adding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.\nHide unnecessary properties\nIf some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.\nDelete any unused pages\nWe suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible.

            "We\u2019re always working to improve your experience with Notion, and we appreciate your feedback and patience. If your databases aren\u2019t feeling very fast when you use them, there are a few reasons why this might be happening, and a few ways you can make improvements.\nThings that can slow your database down\nNumber of pages: If your database has a ton of pages, it might be slower to load.\nNumber of properties: The more visible properties your database has, the longer it might take to load.\nComplex sorts and filters: If your database has a sort or filter on properties like title, text, formula, or rollup, the logic behind it can make load times longer.\nThings you can do to speed up your database setup\nAvoid building too many databases into high-traffic pages",
            "If you have a large workspace, avoid having lots of inline databases, like dashboards, in high-traffic pages. The more simultaneously viewed databases, the more stress on your setup.\nTry housing each database in its own page first. Once you\u2019ve done that, if you\u2019d like all of the databases to be displayed in one page, you can:\nType /linked in that page and select Linked view of a database to create a linked database.\nCreate database views in this linked database and configure them to point to your desired source databases. Different database views can point to different source databases!",
            "When using a single linked database, only one database view is open at a time, and therefore only that one database is listening for updates. You should see an improvement in performance with this setup.\nAvoid complex reference chains\nFormulas and rollups are extremely powerful, but the more complex they are, the slower your database may be. For example, a formula that depends on several other formulas that each depend on rollups may take longer to calculate.\nMinimize the number of filters and sorts on formulas and rollups\nDatabases that are filtered and sorted on formula and rollup properties may take a bit longer to load.\nFilter on simple properties",
            "Adding filters based on simple properties such as select, multi-select, status, number, and date may improve the speed of your database. Even if you have complex filters, this may help by reducing the number of pages that need to be processed.\nHide unnecessary properties\nIf some properties are less important in your database view, hiding them may improve responsiveness and interactivity.\nDelete any unused pages\nWe suggest removing any unnecessary or duplicative pages from your database to keep it as simple and up-to-date as possible. If that\u2019s not an option for you, adding a filter on the Created time property to filter out old pages may significantly improve performance for very large databases.",

Then, a third \u201cFull name\u201d column, a formula would combine both names.\nprop(\"First name\") + \" \" + prop(\"Last name\")\nAnother use case for this is generating URLs by converting different tags to text, then combining them into a URL.

You can extract useful data, run calculations and go beyond Notion\u2019s out-of-the-box options to build custom database properties showing exactly what you need to see.\nIn this guide, you\u2019ll discover how to write formulas and different ways to use them.\nAlready a formulas user?\nClick to expand\nSee the information you need using database formulas",
            "Notion has a wide range of database properties that help you organize and store information. Formulas multiply the power of properties by letting you run calculations and perform operations using the information entered in properties. Results appear across the entire database, and can save you spending time on manual data entry.\nTo put it another way, if Notion blocks were legos, formulas would be the expansion packs allowing you to build the exact system you need with your own custom properties.\nTo add a formula to your database, select Formula in the properties menu, and click Edit property to start writing your formula. Formulas apply across the whole row of a database to calculate, modify or reformat information.",
            "Before we get into examples of formulas, we\u2019ll start by defining some Notion formula terminology.\nNotion formulas terminology\nNotion formulas work on existing properties in your database to produce an output. Unlike a spreadsheet, the formula applies to the entire property.\nIn the formula editor, you\u2019ll find all the different components (think of them like recipe ingredients) you can combine to produce your desired results. You can either select these ingredients from the menu on the left, or type out your formula in the box above.\nThe components of a formula",
            "At the highest level, formulas perform actions on your existing database properties. These actions can be anything from simple mathematical operations \u2014 like adding number columns \u2014 to complex, pre-defined functions like finding the amount of time between two dates.\nWhen writing a formula, you have to choose inputs (the properties you want to perform operations or functions on) then explain the action you want to perform. Then, your output (or result) will be displayed in the database.\nInput properties\nTo begin your formula, you need to have inputs. These can either be database properties, constants such as pi, or literal values that you will type in.",
            "When you use database properties as inputs, the results will change according to how those properties are completed, and will show different results in each row if property values are different.\nFunctions\nFunctions are the instructions of your formula that explain the actions you want to perform on the inputs.\nThis could be anything from multiplying one value by another, subtract one from another, or modifying or reformatting an input in some way.\nOperators can be arithmetic calculations, or comparisons testing one input value against another \u2014 for example to see whether one value is larger or not, or whether a Status property is marked as Complete.\nA concatenation operator combines text or numbers, for example to combine a first and last name.",
            "You can select any properties in the database as inputs. Then, you can perform actions on these using the following elements:",
            "Functions \u2014 Predefined formulas that you can combine into a larger formula. These are more advanced operators that already include inputs, such as dateAdd to add a certain number of days, months, or years to a date, toNumber() to convert text to a\u00a0number, or replaceAll()\u00a0to search text\u00a0for a pattern and replaces all matches with some other text.\nBuilt-ins \u2014 Built-in operators and values you can use in formulas. Operators can be arithmetic (+, -, etc), comparisons (> to show to greater of two values, == to test if two values are the same) or concatenations (+ when used on text will combine both values). Built-in values include true and false.\nPerson and page metadata \u2014\u00a0Reference metadata that isn't part of the database, including a person\u2019s email address or name (person.email(), person.name()), and individual page blocks (block.prop(\"Created By\"), block.prop(\"Last Edited Time\"))",

            "Step 1: Define what you want to achieve \u2014 Before you write the formula you must define the output or result you\u2019re hoping for. Remember that outputs can be in the form of any Notion data type \u2014 text, people, number, checkbox, block or date.\nStep 2: Figure out the inputs you need \u2014 Consider what values and information you need to input in order to produce your desired result. Think about the existing properties in the database \u2014 are there any more properties you need to add? Your formula can contain a mixture of properties, operators and functions.Some useful operators and functions you might include in your formulas:dateAdd \u2014 dateAdd takes a\u00a0date\u00a0input and adds to it, returning a new date. Similar functions are dateSubtract and dateBetween.if  \u2014 Allows you to write\u00a0if-then\u00a0statements in a Notion formula. These statements contain a condition to be evaluated for truthfulness, plus a then statement (if the condition is true) and an else statement (if the condition is false.)contains \u2014 tests whether the first argument contains the second argument (only accepts\u00a0text.)format \u2014 Use format() to reformat dates, booleans, numbers and more to text.",
            "All formula components\nClick to expand\nStep 3: Write and test your formula \u2014 Use the built-in and help center documentation to compose your formula, test and check your results to make sure it works! Pro-tip: test your formula in smaller bits to make sure you\u2019re getting the desired output at each step.\nNesting functions in your formulas\nClick to expand\nNow we\u2019ve gone through formula fundamentals, here are 5 examples you can try out in your own databases.\n1. Calculate sums of money\nIf you have two or more properties in your database you can run calculations like add, subtract, divide multiply, etc.\nCalculations save you from manually entering data (and reduce the risk of human error.)",
            "In a database where you enter all your invoices, create a number property to introduce the net amount of each invoice and another for the percentage of tax.\nNext, create a formula property to calculate the amount of tax per invoice.\nprop(\"Net \") * prop(\"Tax (%)\")\nUsing another formula property, calculate the gross by adding the tax to the net amount.\nprop(\"Net \") + prop(\"Tax ($)\")\nCalculations can be used in many other ways, like calculating commission on sales or converting units of measurement, such as centimeters to feet and inches or Celsius to Fahrenheit.\nNotion formulas perform calculations across properties\nClick to expand\n2. Count and display the number of tags or people",
            "If you use a Notion database to collect ideas and feedback, you can use an Upvote formula to easily count the number of votes for each entry.\nIn a database containing new feature ideas, topic suggestions for a meeting, or product updates that need to be prioritized, people can \u201cUpvote\u201d entries by tagging themselves in a Person property.\nOnce you\u2019ve added a Person property called \u201cUpvoted by\u201d, you can then enter the following formula:\nlength(prop(\"Upvoted by\")) or prop(\"Upvoted by\").length()\nThis will add up the number of people in the \u201cUpvoted By\u201d column, and display that as a number.\nYou could modify this formula to count the number of attendees at a meeting or event, or show how many people are collaborating on a project.\n3. Show time between two dates",
            "With date formulas, calculate the amount of time passed since a date, days to go until a future date, or amount of time between two dates.\nYou can also use dynamic dates in formulas \u2014 last year, next month, a week from today, etc.\nIn a project or task management database, use a formula like this to calculate how much time you have left until a project is due.\ndateBetween(prop(\"Due date\"), now(), \"days\")\nDate formulas are versatile, and they could also be used in a team database to calculate everyone\u2019s age by subtracting their date of birth from today\u2019s date, and to calculate how long each team member has been at the company.\nformat(round(dateBetween(now(), prop(\"Joined\"), \"days\") / (365 / 12) * 10) / 10) + \" months\"\n4. Combine text",
            "The + operator can combine text, or numbers (by first converting the number to text). In a team\u2019s People database, you might have two columns for first and last names. Then, a third \u201cFull name\u201d column, a formula would combine both names.\nprop(\"First name\") + \" \" + prop(\"Last name\")\nAnother use case for this is generating URLs by converting different tags to text, then combining them into a URL. Like in the case of this UTM link generator:\nifs(empty(prop(\"URL\")),\"\", empty(prop(\"UTM Source\")) or empty(prop(\"UTM Medium\")) or empty(prop(\"UTM Campaign\")),   \"You must enter medium, source and campaign name.\", prop(\"URL\") + \"?utm_source=\" + prop(\"UTM Source\") + \"&utm_medium=\" + prop(\"UTM Medium\") + \"&utm_campaign=\" + prop(\"UTM Campaign\"))\n5. Filter relation data",
            "Relation properties bring information from one database into another. If you want to filter the information coming into your database through a relation, you can do so using a formula.\nFor example, you may have a projects database that\u2019s related to your meetings database, and want to filter the related meetings to only show upcoming meetings.\nYou can filter related meetings where the date is later than \u201cnow\u201d.\nprop(\"Meetings\").filter(current.prop(\"Date\") > now())\nHow to troubleshoot errors\nIf your formulas aren\u2019t written correctly, you\u2019ll get an error message when you try to click save. Sometimes, Notion will give you a hint as to what might be wrong - whether it\u2019s a missing bracket or input, or incorrect operation.",
            "However, if you\u2019re not sure why a formula isn\u2019t working, here are some things you can try:",

As well as text, you can add all kinds of blocks to Notion pages \u2014 headers, bullets, checklists, images, videos, files, and embedded content from other apps.

You can click on any of these properties and edit to reflect your classes.\nAdd new properties to organize your notes\nTo add a new property, open one of your notes and click + Add new property. This will open a menu where you can choose from Notion\u2019s range of properties.\nHere are some ways you might use properties to categorize your class notes:",

This comes in handy later, as you\u2019ll be able to filter your database to show all notes about a certain topic.\nSee when you last edited your note \u2014 The Last edited property shows when you last made changes to a page and can help you understand how up-to-date the content is.\nConnect notes to a course or project \u2014 With a Relation property, you can connect one database to another. So you could, for example, connect class notes to a projects database. Then, when you want to work on that project, you\u2019ll find all the relevant notes in one place.\nGet an automatic summary of your note \u2014 Adding an AI Summary property to your database will generate an automatic summary of the page contents.

Then, in Class, check the class you want \u2014 LIT 455, for example. Now, the database will only show notes where you\u2019ve tagged LIT 455 as the relevant class. The rest of the notes remain in the database, and you can turn off the filter anytime.\nTo take this further, you can create new views for different filtered groups of information. So, you could have a separate database view for each class and one for all notes.",
            "To create a new view, click on the + symbol next to views. Select the type of view you want (board, list, table, etc.), and you can then choose how information will appear in that view using filters and sorts.\nHere are some helpful ways you could filter and sort your database:\nView all unfinished notes \u2014 Filter to show all notes where the Status property is not Done.\nSee all notes about a topic \u2014 To view all your class notes about a particular topic, filter to show the topic or topics.\nCreate a \u201cClass by class\u201d view of all notes \u2014\u00a0Add a new view and sort the database by course.

Once you've installed the Web Clipper, you'll see a Notion button appear to the right of your browser search bar.",

When you save a web page, text and images from the web will be brought over to the page, so you can read the content in Notion.\nYou can keep anything from research papers, books, podcasts, articles, and more in your Resources database. Categorize each entry using properties for content type, publication date, author, etc.\nAs with your Class Notes, you can filter and sort items in your Resources database.\nExtract key insights from resources using AI properties",
            "Notion AI can be particularly useful for extracting value from resources you save. There are three types of AI autofill properties: Summary, Key Insights, and Custom, and you can add AI blocks into page content as well.\nHere are a few ways to use Notion AI to get more out of your resources:",
            "Get the main takeaways from a piece of content \u2014 Use the Key Insights property to generate the main takeaways from any resource you\u2019ve saved. This will help you sort through the most valuable articles you\u2019ve saved.\nRead a simplified version of the text \u2014 You can ask Notion AI to simplify the text to make it easier to digest. Just highlight the text, click Ask AI and select Simplify language.\nTranslate or summarize in another language \u2014\u00a0If you\u2019ve saved an important resource that\u2019s not in your first language, you could ask Notion AI to translate the whole piece or just provide a summary in your language. Either highlight the text and ask AI to translate, or, using a Custom AI property, prompt Notion AI to \u201cWrite a summary of this page in Korean\u201d, for example.\nAutomatically highlight keywords \u2014 Again using a Custom AI property, this time, you can prompt Notion AI to highlight the key words from a piece of text, or categorize the content in one or two words.",

Discover Notion AI here.\nLink resources to your work so it\u2019s simpler to reference later\nRelations are Notion properties that allow you to connect databases, so you can create links between information in those databases.\nBy linking your resources to other Notion databases, you can make sure you have all the necessary materials readily available for your work, and also make the job of adding references to your thesis less confusing.",
            "To add a Relation property, go to + Add new property in the Properties menu and select Relation. There, choose the database you want to connect to. You could connect your Resources database to your Class Notes, and this would allow you to link reading material to each note. If you had a database for drafting chapters of your thesis, you could also link this to your Resources databases, so you can attach Resources as you go chapter by chapter.\nInstead of painstakingly going back to search for all your references at the end of a project, in Notion, you can attach sources to your drafts as you go, so nothing gets lost or forgotten.\nOrganize college life",
            "Your first experience of living independently can be daunting. You\u2019re suddenly responsible for so many areas of your life \u2014 groceries, cooking, cleaning, socializing, extracurriculars, and sticking to your student budget.\nNotion is ideal for juggling the demands of college and will help you keep on top of everything you have to do.\nHere are some ways to use Notion for everyday life:",

            "Task reviews & feedback \u2014\u00a0Asana lets you request and give approval on assets and tasks. If your task or project needs approval, use a Person property to tag whoever needs to sign off, or add an additional Status property to indicate whether approval has been granted. Alternatively, create a sub-task for collecting feedback, which will become a separate item in your database.\nForms \u2014You can\u2019t create forms natively in Notion, however it\u2019s possible to embed a Typeform into a Notion page, or integrate Typeform with Notion to automatically sync survey responses to a Notion database.\nTime tracking and workload mapping \u2014 In Asana, you can estimate the required time for a particular task, and track time spent working on those tasks. In Notion, use the suggested Estimates property to score expected time required using a points system. You can also use a Formula property to calculate how much time your team spends on different tasks and projects. First, add \u201ctask start\u201d and \u201ctask complete\u201d date properties to your projects.

            "Every time an employee needs to access company fundamentals or wants to know where to find something, they waste time asking for the keys. Over time, this cripples productivity and scale.\nBuilding a company wiki benefits the entire organization. It consolidates essential information, makes it accessible to everyone and keeps everything up to date \u2014 whether it\u2019s a process everyone should follow or a document that needs to be read.\nHere, we\u2019ll walk you through building your own company wiki (also called a knowledge base) using Notion, and show you how it can save time and help your team grow.\nIn this piece, you\u2019ll learn",

Every question about company-related materials should start at the same place \u2014 and a folder full of pages with no connections or hierarchy doesn\u2019t count.\nYour team deserves a single resource for:",

Instead of asking someone, team members already know where to go for the answer.",
            "But other benefits cascade down from having this mountain of information. It thwarts confusion and misinformation spread, because everyone is working off the same set of documents. It makes updating canonical docs simple, because it only needs to happen in one place. It welcomes collaboration, because employees can read and revisit tentpole company information.\nYour wiki is the set of digital keys to your company that employees new and old share.\nSetting up your company wiki\nLet\u2019s start with a few basics and work our way up from there.\n1. Make a workspace page\nOften, each team at a company will have their own workspace page in Notion (one for engineering, one for marketing, etc.). Think of your shared company information as a team, too.",
            "It needs its own page. And inside that page will be other pages to help you organize company documents, plans or processes. Pages can contain anything, from text to videos to databases.\nTo create a page, hit the + sign next to WORKSPACE in your sidebar. Already inside a page? Just hit /, then type page and press enter.\nWhen you hit /, you\u2019ll see a full menu of content options you can add to a page. This is called the \u201cslash command.\u201d\nBecause you now have one place for company information, distributing this knowledge happens with a single click. Instead of needing to update docs in many places, collect them all, and share multiple times, now you can just direct everyone to your org-wide Notion page.\nThese templates can help get you started\nClick to expand",
            "2. Nest sub-pages inside your wiki\nThe beauty of building a company wiki in Notion is the ability to put many pages inside of one page. This makes for supreme organization of all your most important documents.\nFor example, you can have separate pages in your wiki for benefits, company policies, a team directory, or announcements. These pages all become resources for your employees \u2014 and live side-by-side the work you and your team are doing.",
            "To make a sub-page inside of an existing page, type /page and press enter. Your new page will pop up. Give it a title and add any content you want. Use the back button to return to your wiki.\nMaybe you want to make many pages at once. List all the pages you want as text. Then, select them all, click the \u22ee\u22ee that appears when you hover, click Turn Into and select Page.\nWork and a knowledge base inform each other constantly. You can write a memo on why you\u2019re switching benefits providers in the same workspace as your wiki, making it easy to refer to at any time.",
            "Plus, now your employees know exactly where to go when they need something. Instead of asking you, they can find all these pages from themself. They can even use Notion\u2019s search function. At the top left of your sidebar, there\u2019s a\u00a0Quick Find\u00a0button for all searches. You can also hit\u00a0ctrl\u00a0or\u00a0cmd\u00a0+\u00a0p\u00a0to execute the search function.\nNow that you have the pieces of a wiki, here\u2019s how you can put them together.\nLink out to information from many other sources\nClick to expand\n3. Structure your company wiki\nA clearly-organized wiki makes finding information a no-brainer.",
            "Every company is different, so Notion allows you to customize how your wiki is set up so that it matches your workflow and your team. Other tools feel like you\u2019re working with a slab of marble, rigid and unbending. Notion is like working with malleable clay.\nHeaders are the way to go. Using\u00a0/\u00a0again, choose the header size you want from\u00a0H1\u00a0(the largest),\u00a0H2\u00a0or\u00a0H3\u00a0(the smallest). You can now drag-and-drop different pages under these headers inside your company wiki.\nWe\u2019ve found that columns tend to be the cleanest way to organize collections of pages.",
            "To make a column, you\u2019ll use drag-and-drop again. Grab the \u22ee\u22ee icon next to a header, then drag it all the way over to the right to create another column.

            "To be sure, consolidating these resources will save time for you and employees. Instead of asking someone, team members already know where to go for the answer.\nBut other benefits cascade down from having this mountain of information. It thwarts confusion and misinformation spread, because everyone is working off the same set of documents. It makes updating canonical docs simple, because it only needs to happen in one place. It welcomes collaboration, because employees can read and revisit tentpole company information.\nYour wiki is the set of digital keys to your company that employees new and old share.\nSetting up your company wiki\nLet\u2019s start with a few basics and work our way up from there.\n1. Make a workspace page",
            "Often, each team at a company will have their own workspace page in Notion (one for engineering, one for marketing, etc.). Think of your shared company information as a team, too.\nIt needs its own page. And inside that page will be other pages to help you organize company documents, plans or processes. Pages can contain anything, from text to videos to databases.\nTo create a page, hit the + sign next to WORKSPACE in your sidebar. Already inside a page? Just hit /, then type page and press enter.\nWhen you hit /, you\u2019ll see a full menu of content options you can add to a page. This is called the \u201cslash command.\u201d",
            "Because you now have one place for company information, distributing this knowledge happens with a single click. Instead of needing to update docs in many places, collect them all, and share multiple times, now you can just direct everyone to your org-wide Notion page.\nThese templates can help get you started\nClick to expand\n2. Nest sub-pages inside your wiki\nThe beauty of building a company wiki in Notion is the ability to put many pages inside of one page. This makes for supreme organization of all your most important documents.\nFor example, you can have separate pages in your wiki for benefits, company policies, a team directory, or announcements. These pages all become resources for your employees \u2014 and live side-by-side the work you and your team are doing.",
            "To make a sub-page inside of an existing page, type /page and press enter. Your new page will pop up. Give it a title and add any content you want. Use the back button to return to your wiki.\nMaybe you want to make many pages at once. List all the pages you want as text. Then, select them all, click the \u22ee\u22ee that appears when you hover, click Turn Into and select Page.\nWork and a knowledge base inform each other constantly. You can write a memo on why you\u2019re switching benefits providers in the same workspace as your wiki, making it easy to refer to at any time.",
            "Plus, now your employees know exactly where to go when they need something. Instead of asking you, they can find all these pages from themself. They can even use Notion\u2019s search function. At the top left of your sidebar, there\u2019s a\u00a0Quick Find\u00a0button for all searches. You can also hit\u00a0ctrl\u00a0or\u00a0cmd\u00a0+\u00a0p\u00a0to execute the search function.\nNow that you have the pieces of a wiki, here\u2019s how you can put them together.\nLink out to information from many other sources\nClick to expand\n3. Structure your company wiki\nA clearly-organized wiki makes finding information a no-brainer.",
            "Every company is different, so Notion allows you to customize how your wiki is set up so that it matches your workflow and your team. Other tools feel like you\u2019re working with a slab of marble, rigid and unbending. Notion is like working with malleable clay.\nHeaders are the way to go. Using\u00a0/\u00a0again, choose the header size you want from\u00a0H1\u00a0(the largest),\u00a0H2\u00a0or\u00a0H3\u00a0(the smallest). You can now drag-and-drop different pages under these headers inside your company wiki.\nWe\u2019ve found that columns tend to be the cleanest way to organize collections of pages.",
            "To make a column, you\u2019ll use drag-and-drop again. Grab the \u22ee\u22ee icon next to a header, then drag it all the way over to the right to create another column. The blue guides will help.\nAgain using \u22ee\u22ee, grab any page and drag it into the section where it belongs.\nFor an even tidier look, add divider lines under your headers by typing three hyphens in a row.\nA category like \u201cBenefits\u201d might have pages for \u201cInsurance,\u201d \u201cCommuter,\u201d and \u201cStipends.\u201d A category like \u201cTech\u201d might have pages for \u201cSecurity\u201d and \u201cTools.\u201d\nIf a new employee joins your team, think about how easy it will be for them to get started. Everything\u2019s here for them. They know exactly where to go for information and how to reference it again later \u2014 instead of asking someone multiple times.",

Teams often rely on several tools to get work done, so you need a robust system to bring everything together and bridge the gap between the specialized tools your teams use, and the system to track and manage the work, where collaboration happens.",
            "Sometimes, when teams are using different tools, important information about their work can stay in those tools, hidden from other teams and project managers.

            "And, you can rest assured you\u2019ll always be looking at the latest version of events, as the database will update whenever changes are made in the original tool. Synced Databases are read-only, so although you can bring information into Notion from GitHub and Jira, any changes to a ticket, task or PR need to be made in the original tool, providing a safeguard against unintentional edits and preserving your source of truth. Only team members authorized to edit GitHub or Jira are able to make changes in the tool. It\u2019s a good idea to leave a note at the top of the page letting people know who to get in touch with if they want to make any changes.",
            "Synced Databases help streamline project management and aid collaboration. People from different teams can work together on a single Notion page, where they\u2019ll share content, communicate and collaborate without needing to switch tools. You can also add more context to the information you pull into Notion. With relations and rollups you can link your Jira sprint to a larger team goal that lives in your OKRs database in Notion. When you\u2019re looking at those OKRs, you\u2019ll see relevant info coming from Jira, making it easier to measure and report on your progress.\nHow to create and use Synced Databases with Jira",
            "To set up a Synced Database, you must first authenticate Jira in Notion. To do this, go to Settings & Members in your side bar, and choose My connected apps. Click \u201cConnect\u201d underneath Jira, and you\u2019ll be prompted to authenticate by logging in to your Jira account. After you\u2019ve authenticated once, creating synced databases is as simple as pasting a link.\nYou can now sync Jira boards or entire Jira projects into Notion. Here\u2019s how:\nIn Jira, go to the board or project you want to sync, and copy the link.\nPaste it into Notion and select \u201cPaste as database.\u201d\nAn empty database with a preset list of properties will show up in your page. It will show up in a Notion \u201ctable\u201d view, with all Jira properties automatically added.",
            "The database will start populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.\nFormat your Jira Synced Database\nNotion brings all Jira Issue types (Epics, Stories, Tasks, Bugs, Sub-tasks, etc.) to the synced database, where they\u2019ll appear as separate rows. Every Jira story will be linked to its relevant epic via a property called \u201cParent\u201d, and sprints are also reflected in synced databases as separate properties.\nYou can create specific views using Notion\u2019s database filters, for example, to show all tasks within a Sprint or the Stories, Tasks, and Bugs that make up an Epic.",
            "A kanban board can be a handy way to organize your sprints. To create one, first, select Add view at the top of your synced database and select Board. Then click on database options (\u2026), Group by, and choose Status. Set the Sort to Manual so you can move groups around and have To-Do, In Progress, and Done ordered properly.\nAs with any Notion database, you can create as many filtered views as you need, to organize your information in different ways.\nCreate a calendar view to see when each task was created.\nUse a timeline to visualize how your epics relate to one another, and see how many projects your team is juggling at once.\nAdd a board view grouping tasks by assigned engineer, so you\u2019ll know exactly what everyone\u2019s got on their plate.",
            "How to use Synced Databases with Notion and GitHub\nYou can sync GitHub Issues and Pull Requests into Notion, and anyone who has access to the page will be able to see the content, even if they don\u2019t have access in GitHub.\nJust like with Jira, you first have to authenticate with GitHub. Go to Settings & Members > My connected apps in the top left corner of your screen, and this time, you\u2019ll click the Connect button under GitHub, and authenticate the account.\nSyncing GitHub Issues or Pull Requests\nOnce the authentication is successful, you can copy and paste links to GitHub Issues or Pull Requests into Notion pages.",

            "With the relation property, you can connect information from different databases in Notion. This can help give context and tie information together according to project or team. So you\u2019ll be able to associate GitHub PRs with projects in your roadmap, for example.\nTo add a relation to your Synced Database:\nGo to Properties, and add a new property.\nUnder advanced properties, select Relation as the property type.\nNow a prompt will ask you which database you\u2019d like to relate. Choose and select the relevant database.\nYou can also mention items from your Synced Databases anywhere in Notion by using the @ symbol just as you would mention any Notion page.\nAutomatic relations with Github and Jira",
            "With Github and Jira Synced Databases, you can set up auto-relations, so any time an item in the Synced Database (a Github PR or a Jira Issue for example) includes a link to a Notion page in the auto-related Notion database in its description or title, the relation will automatically be populated. This makes it easier to keep track of Pull Requests and Tasks/Issues in Notion.",

You can create a single source of truth to unite your team by syncing Jira boards, Jira projects, GitHub PRs and GitHub issues as Notion databases.\nWhen you oversee projects involving different teams, it\u2019s challenging to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same page, working with the latest version of events. Teams often rely on several tools to get work done, so you need a robust system to bring everything together and bridge the gap between the specialized tools your teams use, and the system to track and manage the work, where collaboration happens.",
            "Sometimes, when teams are using different tools, important information about their work can stay in those tools, hidden from other teams and project managers. By created Synced Databases with GitHub and Jira, you can bring information from those tools into Notion, which provides clarity for everyone involved and means you\u2019ll spend less time hopping between tools, asking for updates or searching for the latest versions of files.\nNo more silos \u2014 collaborate seamlessly by bringing external work into Notion\nYou can easily create Notion databases that sync with your Jira boards, Jira projects, GitHub PRs and GitHub issues, bringing information from those tools into a database you can use to manage, track and oversee projects.",
            "Synced Databases make life easier for all your team members, especially those who don\u2019t use GitHub or Jira, but still need to see what\u2019s going on. Instead of asking for logins and trying to navigate an unfamiliar tool, they\u2019ll have access to everything they need right in the Notion database.\nNo more pinging engineers on Slack for updates on an urgent bug fix \u2014 you can just go straight into the database and see whether it\u2019s done, saving everyone time and stress.\nYou\u2019ll never have to manually update database entries with screenshots or links either, as the information will automatically pull through to the database for everyone to see.",
            "And, you can rest assured you\u2019ll always be looking at the latest version of events, as the database will update whenever changes are made in the original tool. Synced Databases are read-only, so although you can bring information into Notion from GitHub and Jira, any changes to a ticket, task or PR need to be made in the original tool, providing a safeguard against unintentional edits and preserving your source of truth. Only team members authorized to edit GitHub or Jira are able to make changes in the tool. It\u2019s a good idea to leave a note at the top of the page letting people know who to get in touch with if they want to make any changes.",
            "Synced Databases help streamline project management and aid collaboration. People from different teams can work together on a single Notion page, where they\u2019ll share content, communicate and collaborate without needing to switch tools. You can also add more context to the information you pull into Notion. With relations and rollups you can link your Jira sprint to a larger team goal that lives in your OKRs database in Notion. When you\u2019re looking at those OKRs, you\u2019ll see relevant info coming from Jira, making it easier to measure and report on your progress.\nHow to create and use Synced Databases with Jira",
            "To set up a Synced Database, you must first authenticate Jira in Notion. To do this, go to Settings & Members in your side bar, and choose My connected apps. Click \u201cConnect\u201d underneath Jira, and you\u2019ll be prompted to authenticate by logging in to your Jira account. After you\u2019ve authenticated once, creating synced databases is as simple as pasting a link.\nYou can now sync Jira boards or entire Jira projects into Notion. Here\u2019s how:\nIn Jira, go to the board or project you want to sync, and copy the link.\nPaste it into Notion and select \u201cPaste as database.\u201d\nAn empty database with a preset list of properties will show up in your page. It will show up in a Notion \u201ctable\u201d view, with all Jira properties automatically added.",
            "The database will start populating automatically and will continue to sync if you navigate away from the page.\nFormat your Jira Synced Database\nNotion brings all Jira Issue types (Epics, Stories, Tasks, Bugs, Sub-tasks, etc.) to the synced database, where they\u2019ll appear as separate rows. Every Jira story will be linked to its relevant epic via a property called \u201cParent\u201d, and sprints are also reflected in synced databases as separate properties.\nYou can create specific views using Notion\u2019s database filters, for example, to show all tasks within a Sprint or the Stories, Tasks, and Bugs that make up an Epic.",
            "A kanban board can be a handy way to organize your sprints. To create one, first, select Add view at the top of your synced database and select Board. Then click on database options (\u2026), Group by, and choose Status. Set the Sort to Manual so you can move groups around and have To-Do, In Progress, and Done ordered properly.\nAs with any Notion database, you can create as many filtered views as you need, to organize your information in different ways.\nCreate a calendar view to see when each task was created.\nUse a timeline to visualize how your epics relate to one another, and see how many projects your team is juggling at once.\nAdd a board view grouping tasks by assigned engineer, so you\u2019ll know exactly what everyone\u2019s got on their plate.",
            "How to use Synced Databases with Notion and GitHub\nYou can sync GitHub Issues and Pull Requests into Notion, and anyone who has access to the page will be able to see the content, even if they don\u2019t have access in GitHub.\nJust like with Jira, you first have to authenticate with GitHub. Go to Settings & Members > My connected apps in the top left corner of your screen, and this time, you\u2019ll click the Connect button under GitHub, and authenticate the account.\nSyncing GitHub Issues or Pull Requests\nOnce the authentication is successful, you can copy and paste links to GitHub Issues or Pull Requests into Notion pages.",

            "With the relation property, you can connect information from different databases in Notion. This can help give context and tie information together according to project or team.

            "As a teamspace owner, you can decide who can view, edit, and share content. Open, closed, and private teams dictate how a workspace member can join a teamspace, while permission levels determine how they interact with content.",
            "Choose whether to make the teamspace Open, Closed or Private \u2014 Anyone can view content and join Open teamspaces. Everyone can see Closed teamspaces, but can\u2019t join unless you invite them.  Private teamspaces are only visible to members.\nCustomize access levels for teamspace owners, members, and everyone else \u2014 In an Open teamspace, you can choose which permission level to give people who aren\u2019t members of the teamspace: either Can Edit, Can Comment, or Can View. In Closed teamspaces, you can change the permission levels for members, and you also have the option to restrict access for everyone who isn\u2019t a teamspace member.\nDecide who can invite members to the teamspace and edit the sidebar \u2014 You can allow everyone to edit the sidebar, or make it so that only teamspace owners can. In Closed and Private teams, select whether all members, or only owners, can invite others to the teamspace.",
            "In the \u201cMembers\u201d tab, you can:\nAdd individual people or groups to the teamspace \u2014 Type their name and click \u201c+ Add\u201d. As well as individuals, you can also add whole groups.\nSet custom permissions for groups (Enterprise plans only) \u2014 You can give additional access to a subset of teamspace members. When you\u2019ve added a group to the teamspace, go to the dropdown next to the group\u2019s name, and select \u201cCustom permissions.\u201d You can\u2019t give less access than the teamspace default - only more. So, if the teamspace default is \u201cCan Edit\u201d, you can assign \u201cFull access\u201d to a particular group.\nEdit member status \u2014 Change members to owners (and vice versa), or remove people altogether from the teamspace, by opening the dropdown next to individual or group name.",
            "In the \u201cSecurity tab,\u201d you can:\nChoose whether to give people the option to share pages to the web \u2014 You could create a single teamspace for all publicly shared pages. By consolidating all public pages in one teamspace, you keep control over what\u2019s going out of your company\u2019s workspace.\nRemove guests from sensitive teamspaces\u2014 Some things are too sensitive to be shared externally. You can globally prevent members from adding guests to important teamspaces, like financial analyses, or HR reporting.\nPrevent certain pages from being exported \u2014 You can disable exporting pages as Markdown, CSV, or PDF files, so you can avoid confidential information being copied outside of the workspace.",
            "You can configure the security settings of your teamspace to ensure that your information stays restricted in the way you intent, without preventing your employees from accessing content they need.\nGet granular and customize permission settings at page level\nAs well as adjusting overall teamspace settings, you can change permissions at the individual page level. By default, pages in a teamspace will inherit the same permission settings as the teamspace as a whole. However, you can customize permissions for each page, so you have the power to decide who can view, make changes, leave comments, or share pages with others.",
            "To see who has what level of access to a page, open the \u201cShare\u201d menu at the top right corner. Here, you\u2019ll see a list of the groups and individuals with access, and what level of access they have.\nThere are 5 different levels of access available:\nFull access \u2014 you can edit the page and share it with others.\nCan edit\u00a0\u2014 you can edit the page, but not share it.\nCan comment\u00a0\u2014 you can\u2019t edit the page, but can view it and leave comments.\nCan view\u00a0\u2014 you can view the page but not leave comments, share or edit.\nNo access\u00a0\u2014 the page is hidden from you and it will not appear in search.",
            "For database pages only, there\u2019s an additional Can edit content option. This means you can edit a page inside a database, including filling out property values, but you won\u2019t be able to change the structure, views, filters, sorts, or properties of the database.\nIf you share a page with someone who isn\u2019t a member of the Teamspace it belongs in, they\u2019ll see it in their shared menu, and the same is true when you share a private page.\nWhen permissions levels and teamspaces interact, individuals will always retain the most permissive access levels. So, if you\u2019re part of two teamspaces - \u201cMarketing Team\u201d and \u201cManagers\u201d, wherever \u201cMarketing Team\u201d has read only access, but \u201cManagers\u201d can comment, you\u2019ll have permission to comment.",
            "To give another example, you\u2019ll always have at least one teamspace which includes everyone, by default. In this \u201cGeneral\u201d teamspace, you could set the default permissions to read only, but, using groups, assign \u201cFull Access\u201d to the People team for certain pages, such as the benefits information.\nRead all about sharing & permissions\nLearn how to add members, guests & admins\nExplore top-level security available in workspace settings",

Then, you\u2019ll choose the database you require, and your information will now appear as an in-line table inside the page.\nAdd the necessary filters to make sure your linked database only shows the information relevant to the page you\u2019re in. For example, in the homepage for the project you\u2019re launching next week, add a linked database which is filtered to show only meeting notes relevant to that project.\nYou can use this linked database to easily add new project notes, which the entire company can see in the original database if they want. At the same time, you don't have to distract your project team with all company-wide notes. Everything syncs seamlessly!",

            "Connect your notes and docs to your projects \u2014 using a Relation property, you can connect Docs and Meeting Notes to your product team's project database. That way, everything related to a project is in one place. You can see why a decision was made on a project by looking through the old meeting notes associated with it. How to do it here.\nUse backlinks to see where Meeting Notes or Docs pages are shared \u2014 if you\u2019re sharing Meeting Notes or Docs elsewhere in Notion between teams, backlinks give you a map. You can see where a specific page has been shared, and where it hasn\u2019t. This helps your team easily navigate all related work. More info on backlinks here.\nCreate a culture of documentation\u2014 requiring that decisions, meetings, etc. all be documented helps your team learn collectively and onboard more easily. As a company, Notion actually has only one Meeting Notes database and one Docs database, and all teams use these two resources. That way, everyone in the company can see what individual teams or people are up to, and teams can use more granular views and linked databases to focus on what's relevant to them.",

Use the Select property to create a tag for \"Project Kickoff.\" You can use another Select property and leave that blank \u2014 this is where you'll create new tags depending on the project. Headers here can include \"Goals\" with checkboxes underneath, and \"Competitor analysis\" with a prompt for screenshots.\nUser interview \u2014 it's important to stay connected with your users.

And ensuring all of this has a specific home makes knowledge centrally available to everyone.\nLink to Meeting Notes and Docs from your team's homepage \u2014 managing everything in Notion lets you create homes for every team in your org. Design can have its own homepage with all relevant team info, with pages like \"Brand Assets\" and \"Inspiration.\" You can link to your Meeting Notes or Docs lists here to make them easily accessible. Drag them from your sidebar into your design homepage or wiki and they become links in the design section of your Notion workspace.\nDrag a page out of your list \u2014 most documents will stay in your list. But, in your Docs list, if you've created an RFC for a new brand font, got all the feedback, and worked on the project in that page, you can now move it into your team's wiki so everyone can start using it. Use \u22ee\u22ee to drag-and-drop this page into another section in your sidebar, or from the \u22ee\u22ee menu, select Move to and choose where you want it to go.",

For a project spec, headers might include \u201cProblem statement,\" \"Goals,\" and \"Screenshot examples.\" For a set of meeting notes, headers might be \"Agenda\" and \"Discussion items.\"\nDrag-and-drop \u2014 seriously, you can move anything around in these pages. Hover over what you'd like to move and grab \u22ee\u22ee. You can create columns by dragging something all the way to the right (the blue guides will help). For example, if your design team is working on a new dropdown menu, place an example image on the left, and bulleted notes about it on the right.",

Make templates to standardize processes in your lists\nFor meetings or docs that your team repeats all the time \u2014 like weekly standups, or project kickoffs \u2014 you can add a re-usable template to your databases.\u00a0Instead of remaking headers, sections, checklists and more, a template gives you exactly the format you need instantly.",

            "Weekly standups \u2014 you can create headers for \"Agenda\" or \"Action items,\" things that'll likely be part of every meeting. Using the Select property type, create a tag for \"Weekly Standup.\" Then using the Person property, tag its usual attendees. Whenever you use this template, everything from the text to the properties will be recreated with a single click.\nRetros & post-mortems \u2014 again, use a Select property, create a \"Retro\" or \"Post-Mortem\" tag. Inside the template, you can have headers for \"Problem,\" \"Screenshots,\" and \"Proposed solution,\" so every problem you encounter is analyzed using the same set of criteria.\nSyncs about specific projects \u2014 use the Select property to create tags based on the project, like \"Website Banner Redesign.\" The Person property can be used to tag the meeting's regular participants here too.",
            "For Docs\nFor Docs, templates allow you to put a system in place that's followed by all of your designers, helping standardize processes across the team.",
            "Feature RFC \u2014 a system we use at Notion called \"Request for Comment,\" which opens up an idea for team commentary. Using the Select property type, create a tag for \"Feature RFC.\" Include headers like \"Problem,\" \"Necessary context,\" \"Proposed solution\" and \"Action items.\" You can also add text under each of these that includes instructions for your team so everyone can use conduct likeminded analysis.\nProject kickoff \u2014 your design team will probably have many projects, so this template can help ensure you're all thinking similarly. Use the Select property to create a tag for \"Project Kickoff.\" You can use another Select property and leave that blank \u2014 this is where you'll create new tags depending on the project. Headers here can include \"Goals\" with checkboxes underneath, and \"Competitor analysis\" with a prompt for screenshots.\nUser interview \u2014 it's important to stay connected with your users. Use the Select property to create a \"User Interview\" tag. Inside the body of the page, add headers for background information, questions asked, responses, and conclusions.",
            "5. Best practices from the Notion design team for your Meeting Notes and Docs\nWhen asked how Notion manages its documentation system, designer Cory Etzkorn says, \u201cWriting documentation is critical for scaling a design system and brand. It makes employee onboarding painless and decision-making more transparent.\u201d\nDocumentation is critical to our designers' success \u2014 particularly because they sit on different teams. Our Meeting Notes list helps maintain transparency, so everyone can feel like they're involved in a meeting, even if they weren't there. And our Docs list helps our designers collaborate with our product team, because they can share ideas in a single place.\u00a0Our work becomes more efficient because there's a written account of everything we do.",
            "Here are a few tricks we've learned to manage your design team's note-taking system:",
            "Require documentation in a specific place \u2014 getting your designers to write everything down will help build a culture of documentation and learning. Whether it's an idea about a product improvement or a quick project sync between engineering and design teams, all this information is valuable. And ensuring all of this has a specific home makes knowledge centrally available to everyone.\nLink to Meeting Notes and Docs from your team's homepage \u2014 managing everything in Notion lets you create homes for every team in your org. Design can have its own homepage with all relevant team info, with pages like \"Brand Assets\" and \"Inspiration.\" You can link to your Meeting Notes or Docs lists here to make them easily accessible. Drag them from your sidebar into your design homepage or wiki and they become links in the design section of your Notion workspace.\nDrag a page out of your list \u2014 most documents will stay in your list. But, in your Docs list, if you've created an RFC for a new brand font, got all the feedback, and worked on the project in that page, you can now move it into your team's wiki so everyone can start using it. Use \u22ee\u22ee to drag-and-drop this page into another section in your sidebar, or from the \u22ee\u22ee menu, select Move to and choose where you want it to go.",

            "Create a list database \u2014 Add a new page in your sidebar and choose List from the menu. It's the most minimalist database view for easy focus. Every page inside it can be a meeting.\nAdd properties \u2014 For every set of notes, you can assign properties that show attributes like when the meeting took place, who was there, and what type of meeting it was.Click Properties at the top right of your list, then + Add a property.Choose the property type and give it a name, like Participants for a Person property to tag who was there, or Date for a Created time property that adds a time stamp, or Type for a Select property to tag standup, weekly sync, sprint planning, post mortem, etc. You could even have a Select property called Team if you wanted to tag meetings by engineering sub-team \u2014 like mobile, desktop, internal tools, etc.Create and customize as many properties as you want. Learn about all property types.\nHide/show properties \u2014 Only view the properties you want to see in your list. Maybe you only want to see date and time created. Click Properties again and switch on the ones you want.",
            "Add views for teams or projects\nNotion makes it possible to view the same database many ways \u2014 as a table, Kanban board, calendar, filtered by properties, etc. You can add multiple versions of your information in one place and switch between them instantly. No need to re-create content or re-apply filters.",

For example, choose Board to see your notes grouped by meeting type or by sub-team.\nOr choose\u00a0List\u00a0again and apply a filter. Let's say you want a list of only weekly syncs. Create a new list view, then hit\u00a0Filter\u00a0at the top right and set the Type property to Weekly Sync. Now you can toggle between all meetings and just syncs.

But creating each of these from scratch, every time, can be time-consuming and inefficient.\nIn Notion, database templates help you quickly spin up pages for these recurring workflows, ready to go with frameworks customized to each project. Not only for speed, database templates also give you the opportunity to solidify a process for your team \u2014 like making sure there's action items from every meeting, or each bug reported has a screenshot.\nHere, we\u2019ll look at how you can use database templates to streamline tasks and create more clear-cut procedures for execution.\nWhat are database templates?",
            "Database templates are pages unique to your database that you can use over and over again. Your meeting notes database can have a set of templates for different types of meetings (1:1s, stand-ups), or your tasks database can have templates unique to each type of task (bug fixes, project specs).\nImagine starting a meeting with sections for an agenda, updates, discussion notes, meeting participants, and action items already set up and ready for your team to add to. Or, when reporting a bug, there's a section in the template to reproduce that bug, so the engineering team can fix it without requiring a back-and-forth to get it done.",
            "Database templates create structure that your team (or cross-functional teams) follows. Along with making information standardized and actionable, they ensure:\nProjects start off on the right foot.\nEdge cases are considered.\nYour team has clear guidelines and standards.\nTeammates can get and up running on a new project in minutes.\nYour team is sharing learnings by updating templates.\nBefore we go any further, it\u2019s helpful to know the difference between templates and database templates.

When creating a new page in a database, you'll also see the + New template option in the body of the new page.\nTemplates in a database are only available in the specific database where you made and saved them.\nHow to customize your database templates\nBy spending time upfront building out templates, you can get hours back in the long run. Since each database template is customizable to the work at hand, here's some ways you can mold them to your needs:",
            "Properties \u2014 set default properties that auto-populate when using a specific template. For example, if someone\u2019s reporting a bug, make sure it\u2019s always categorized as a bug whenever the template is used. Or, if you have an engineer always responsible for bugs, you can make sure they\u2019re automatically tagged in a Person property every time that template is used.",

Let\u2019s say you\u2019re putting together a template so that anyone from marketing to HR can report product bugs. Consider having larger headers covering the bug description, supporting links, and screenshots illustrating the issue. Think of headers like sections of your template your team will need to fill out.\nPrompts under headers \u2014 while you\u2019ve got headers to help separate your information, underneath those headers you can include some context for what to include.

Start simple and build on top of it. Begin with basic blocks, and if your processes require it, turn it into a tasks database. Keep in mind, the value your system delivers should always be greater than the work it takes to upkeep the system.\nBasic blocks\nIf you decide to start simple and use basic blocks to track your tasks, then the foundation of your system will be the to-do block.",

The to-do block allows you to easily create a checkbox item, as well as give you the ability to satisfyingly cross things off as you go. From there, you can add a due date and set up a reminder for the task if you\u2019d like (by using the @ symbol).\nAnother helpful block for simple task management is the toggle block. To create a toggle, you can either type /toggle or >. The toggle block allows you to nest blocks within it so you can neatly track projects that may contain several tasks.",

Alternatively, type /columns to choose the number of columns you want to create. You can also drag-and-drop to move tasks from one column to another, or even to an \u201cArchive\u201d sub-page to keep a record of previously completed tasks.\nDatabases\nIf your tasks have several moving parts or dependencies, databases might be the better option for you.

The most common one we see is setting a due date for each task.\nSelect \u2014 the Select property allows you to create and customize how you tag tasks in your database. Any tags you\u2019ve created will show up as a dropdown list to choose from. We often see users leverage the Select property to create tags for priority (High, Medium, Low) or the project type.\nViews",

Start simple and build on top of it. Begin with basic blocks, and if your processes require it, turn it into a tasks database.

Having all these tasks side by side gets confusing, and it\u2019s hard to move forward when you\u2019re unsure of what comes next.\nIf you find yourself with more than 50 rows in your tasks database, sub-tasks and dependencies can help you get a clearer picture of exactly what needs to get done by breaking big tasks down into smaller actions.\nIt\u2019s easier to scope out the steps to complete a task, share the workload amongst your team by assigning specific steps to different team members, and define what needs to happen for a task to be marked \u201ccomplete\u201d.",

Click Filter then + Add a filter. Maybe you want to see only P1 projects related to your desktop app. You can filter to see just those. Then you can hit Sort and + Add a sort to organize them by launch date. Views preserve the filters or sorts you apply, so you don't have to recreate them every time.To switch between views you've created, simply click that same view menu. They're all there!

This tidies up all the info in pages and makes it digestible.\nEmbeds just for product teams \u2014 bring all your team's tools together in one place for effective work. Engineers can share a code snippet by typing /code. Designers can embed prototypes by typing /figma or /invision. You can even include a feedback form with /typeform. As a PM, you can create a better, more collaborative working environment because Notion supports many tools your team is using.\nPages inside of pages \u2014 you can nest pages inside of your project pages infinitely. Whether it's an archive of previous design iterations from designers, or a collection of user interviews, each can be neatly organized in a page.

            "Your project management and roadmapping system sets the process your product team will follow from a high level. Templates make it even more granular.\u00a0Every project has a unique set of considerations, and templates help ensure PMs capture them. Define and use the same formats again and again for authoring specs, conducting user interviews, and more.\nTemplates help create a hive mind for your team, where they're able to operate off the same principles when starting any new process.\nTo create a template, look at the right side of your board and click the down arrow next to the blue\u00a0New\u00a0button. Select\u00a0+ New template. A blank page will pop up. This is where you'll create the template once, then use it repeatedly (don't worry, you can update it whenever).",
            "For product teams specifically, here are a few ideas for templates:",
            "Project spec \u2014 used to start any project, this template helps ensure your PMs are considering its entire scope. Under an \"Overview\" H2 header, you can include H3 headers for \"Problem Statement\" and \"Proposed Work.\" Under a \"Dependencies & Risks\" H2 header, you can include H3 headers for \"Stakeholders\" and \"Risks.\" You should also have an H2 for \"Success Criteria\" so your product team can track goals.\nUser interview \u2014 it's important to maintain a solid relationship with your users. This template helps your product managers get the most from all these interviews. Be sure to include an Email or Phone property here, so you record the user's contact info. In the body of the template, you can have different H2 headers for \"User Feedback,\" \"Interview Observations,\" and \"Action Items.\" You can even include a list of questions that have proven useful and make them standard across your team.\nRFC \u2014 also called \"request for comment,\" this is a type of page we use at Notion to solicit team feedback. In your Select property for the project \"Type,\" make a tag for \"RFC.\" You should also have another Select property for \"Status,\" where you can add tags for \"Open for Comment,\" \"In Progress\" and \"Archived.\" Use a People property titled \"Reviewers\" to assign the folks responsible for giving you feedback. You can then create headers for specs or code blocks, and prompt your reviewers to leave comments. When you're ready, share the link to this on Slack with your team.",
            "It's easy to see how templates help your team cement processes. But they also help your team grow.\u00a0New PMs can see how your team works and start following this thought process instantly. And when their fresh eyes see something you forgot to include? You can update any template with a click, and start using it widely.\n5. Linking all related project work in your cards\nOne of Notion's most powerful features is the ability to connect information across databases. Using a\u00a0Relation\u00a0property, you can sync all the meeting notes or tasks related to a project right inside that project's card.",
            "This is where Notion shines \u2014 once your entire company is using it, you can begin connecting what were once disparate project pieces in a single place. No more searching endlessly for that one document you need. Everything is bundled together for easy access.\nHere's how to set this up:",
            "You'll want to make a Task List for either your entire company or specific teams. You can use this template to get started. With it, you'll have a list of everyone's tasks, which you can then assign to the larger projects they're related to.\nAnother good thing to fold into your projects are all relevant meeting notes. Here's a template you can use to make a company (or team)-wide Meeting Notes system. We've also created specific meeting notes & docs recommendations for engineering and design teams.\nGreat. Now you have two databases for Tasks and Meeting Notes. In your project management and roadmapping system, add a Relation property and title it \"Tasks.\" You'll be prompted to select a database \u2014 choose your Task List. Then do the same for Meeting Notes. You'll now be able to link any pages from these databases in your cards.\nLet's say you have a project to improve commenting on your mobile app. You'd go to your Task List and create all the tasks needed to complete that project. Then, in the your card for the Improve Commenting on Mobile project, you can link all the tasks that roll up into that project, like \"Comment Suggestions\" or \"Copy and Paste Capabilities.\" You can also sync all meeting notes about the project, like from the standup you have with engineering and design teams working on the feature.\nIn your Task List or Meeting Notes databases, you can create a Relation property titled \"Project,\" which allows you to sync both ways. Whenever you have a meeting, tag the project you talked about in the notes. Any updates you make in the Task List or Meeting Notes databases will be reflected in your project management and roadmapping system.\nAnother useful\u00a0Relation\u00a0property? \"User Research.\" If you build a separate database to keep track of user interviews, you can connect them to your projects. Anytime you conduct a user interview that might be beneficial for a specific project, just link it inside that project's card so you have full context from the people using it most.",

This also means those outside the team don't know where to go if they have questions.\nRigid systems that inhibit your process \u2014 don't let software's limitations define your process. You should be able to mold software to your needs instead of shoehorning information into it.",
            "In Notion, you can create a custom project management and roadmapping system that puts all the information from the teams you're working with front and center.",

            "This project management and roadmapping system can be the foundation for your product team's growth.\u00a0Because Notion is both structured and malleable, the tools you build in it grow with you as you add more teammates or change the way you do things.\nHow to set up your product team's project management & roadmapping system\nNo matter your team's size or the number of projects you're tackling, all your product work starts here. Here's how to set it up, with recommendations tailored to busy PMs.\n1. A board that tracks every project\nYou can make a number of different databases in Notion: lists, tables, calendars, etc. But here, we'll focus on creating a board, which is a collection of individuals project pages you can move from one stage of a process to the next.",
            "By typing /, you'll get a menu of what you can add to a Notion page. We call this the \"slash command,\" a universal menu of everything you can do in Notion.\nTo create your board, type /board and select Board - Full page. A completely new page that's just your board will pop up.\nAt the top of your board are columns. You can change these to reflect each phase in your product team's process. We've set you up with the basics: \"Not started,\" \"In progress,\" and \"Complete.\" You can customize them to your specific needs.\nIn your board, you'll see a few cards. Each one can be a project. And inside each card, you'll see several different properties, which are important because you'll organize your board based on them. For instance, you can have a date property to capture projects' due dates. You can have a person property to capture stakeholders. You can even add tags to denote which team owns the project or what type of project it is.To add a property to your board, click +Add a property. You'll be prompted to give it a name and choose the type of property you want.You can group your board by any property by clicking \u2022\u2022\u2022 at the top right of your board and selecting Group By. For example, group your board by project owners to see all projects organized underneath the people responsible for them.\nGo ahead and grab a card and move it from one column to the next. Now visualize yourself moving every project into the \"Complete\" column. Feels good, right?",
            "This board is the foundation for getting things done as a group. Each of its structural components are important to what you're building \u2014 columns for your process, cards for project info, properties for organization.\nAnd because all projects live in one place, anyone can see their status. You're creating a window of transparency for both your team and for the entire organization.\n2. Customize your database\nEvery product team works differently. Using Notion, you can create a project management and roadmapping system that matches your team's workflow. Here are a couple tips for doing that:",
            "Show properties in your board view \u2014 instead of clicking into cards to see all their properties, you can display the most relevant ones right on cards in your board. In an instant, you can get a view of the projects your team is working on, their priority, who owns them, and any other properties you want at your fingertips. On the top right of your table, click \u2022\u2022\u2022 and hit Properties. Toggle the ones you want displayed in your board view. To rearrange them, use the \u22ee\u22ee icon.\nCreate different views\u00a0\u2014 Notion allows you to slice the same dataset many ways. You can have a view of your database that's only projects launching this week. You can have one for projects you're collaborating with the design team on. You can have another for only mobile projects. Best of all, you can immediately toggle between them.To do this, click + Add a view near your board's title. Then select the type of database you want, name it, and hit Create. You can view your board as a table too, or as a calendar showing when you're working on what.You can now apply different filters to surface only information you want and need. Click Filter then + Add a filter. Maybe you want to see only P1 projects related to your desktop app. You can filter to see just those. Then you can hit Sort and + Add a sort to organize them by launch date. Views preserve the filters or sorts you apply, so you don't have to recreate them every time.To switch between views you've created, simply click that same view menu. They're all there! This opens up a lot of potential. Every team your board connects could create a view of just their tasks so they're easier to see. Even individuals could create their own task boards (giving everyone visibility into their priorities).",

All in one place.\nProperties and views just for product teams\nClick to expand\n3. Working right inside your project management system\nNow that you have a system for managing projects, let's turn our attention to the cards on your board. This is where you'll house all the information related to your projects.",
            "Because PMs work so cross-functionally, they juggle every tool used by the teams they're collaborating with.\u00a0Engineers, designers, and marketers all use unique software. Even feedback is tucked away in these tools, making it hard to find, like buried treasure without a map.\nIn Notion, all teams, tools, and commentary for a project come together. This creates more effective communication and streamlined work \u2014 instead of your PMs shuffling through software to make sure everything is accounted for.",
            "Customize every page \u2014 every project requires different documentation, organized so it's easy to navigate and use. Notion gives PMs just enough flexibility to arrange information that suits the current task. For instance, by typing /heading, you can select from H1, H2, or H3 headers. Then, using the \u22ee\u22ee icon, you can drag-and-drop images, text, sub-pages and more under these headers. This tidies up all the info in pages and makes it digestible.\nEmbeds just for product teams \u2014 bring all your team's tools together in one place for effective work. Engineers can share a code snippet by typing /code. Designers can embed prototypes by typing /figma or /invision. You can even include a feedback form with /typeform. As a PM, you can create a better, more collaborative working environment because Notion supports many tools your team is using.\nPages inside of pages \u2014 you can nest pages inside of your project pages infinitely. Whether it's an archive of previous design iterations from designers, or a collection of user interviews, each can be neatly organized in a page. This gives your product team a way to collect all the information for a project, from spec to launch, and organize it cleanly.\nReal-time feedback\u00a0\u2014 using the\u00a0@\u00a0symbol, you can tag teammates in comments and discussions to collaborate. Tag a designer to review your new dropdown menu or a copywriter to approve final text.

            "She continues, \"Relations allow us to associate heterogeneous entities. A set of tasks can be related to a project, which in turn relates to meeting notes and design documents. The result is a system that captures what's happening and how all of the constituent pieces fit together.\"\nHere are a few tips we've learned for managing our engineering project management system:",
            "Create a linked version of your database for engineering sub-teams \u2014 if you have sub-teams, it's a great idea to create a database view that's only their tasks and projects. Inside your engineering wiki, each team can have their own page, like one for your infrastructure and platform teams. At the top of the page can be a version of the project management and roadmap system that's filtered just to show the infrastructure team's epics. This helps encourage focus without losing transparency for what the eng team at large is working on.\nLink your meeting notes to your project management system \u2014 just like tasks are linked to epics, you can also link all meeting notes to your epics. Create another Relation property and link it to a meeting notes database. That way, you can have every discussion about a project cataloged along with its tasks. This type of asynchronous communication helps foster transparency and keep everyone in the loop, even engineers who weren't in the room during the meeting.\nAssign a clear owner for every epic and task \u2014 make two Person properties in your epics and tasks, one for the project owner and another for the team responsible for executing it. By having a clear owner, anyone who has a question about the project knows who to ask. This makes for clear, streamlined, cross-functional communication.",

A list of all your databases will appear. Search for the database you're currently in. After selecting it, you'll be given two options for the type of relation you want to create.

            "Customize every page \u2014 different projects require different documentation, each arranged so they're easy to navigate. Notion gives you just enough structure so that you can organize information however best fits the task at hand. Create headers inside of pages by typing /heading. Then, make columns by grabbing the \u22ee\u22ee icon and dragging and header all the way to the right. Using the \u22ee\u22ee icon, drag-and-drop text, images, videos and more under those headers for a neat and tidy page that's easy to digest.\nEmbeds just for engineers \u2014 engineers use a unique set of tools to get their work done. Notion brings all of them together. Type /code to include a code snippet right in your page, like when you're launching new mobile and tablet controls and want to see if the code looks right to your team. Or you can share a GitHub gist by typing /gist. You can even include an /image or /video to show those new controls in action right in the page.",

Add infinite layers of pages to capture all the information you need to complete anything, and give yourself and your team clear pathways to find everything in your sidebar by opening the toggles.\nFeedback in real time \u2014 use the @ symbol to mention one of your teammates to get feedback on a project. A fellow engineer can make some notes in your code. A designer can provide comments on a Figma file you've embedded of the new dropdown menu. Normally, designers and engineers would be siloed in their own tools. Instead, Notion connects cross-functional teams for tight feedback loops.\nDecisions made with full context \u2014 inside pages, you can have a running thought process for every aspect of a project. Include notes about why a task got de-prioritized or why your team changed the code guidelines on mobile.

Templates standardize your processes\nIn your project management system, you can create templates unique to each problem an engineer will tackle.\nTemplates help engineers approach problems the same way every time. This leads to a consistent problem-solving approach that saves time and builds strong institutional knowledge.\u00a0For example, in a bug report, you'll have headings prompting your engineers to get screenshots and replicate the bug \u2014 this helps surface what information you'll need to find an answer faster.",

The result is a system that captures what's happening and how all of the constituent pieces fit together.\"\nHere are a few tips we've learned for managing our engineering project management system:",
            "Create a linked version of your database for engineering sub-teams \u2014 if you have sub-teams, it's a great idea to create a database view that's only their tasks and projects. Inside your engineering wiki, each team can have their own page, like one for your infrastructure and platform teams. At the top of the page can be a version of the project management and roadmap system that's filtered just to show the infrastructure team's epics. This helps encourage focus without losing transparency for what the eng team at large is working on.\nLink your meeting notes to your project management system \u2014 just like tasks are linked to epics, you can also link all meeting notes to your epics. Create another Relation property and link it to a meeting notes database. That way, you can have every discussion about a project cataloged along with its tasks. This type of asynchronous communication helps foster transparency and keep everyone in the loop, even engineers who weren't in the room during the meeting.\nAssign a clear owner for every epic and task \u2014 make two Person properties in your epics and tasks, one for the project owner and another for the team responsible for executing it. By having a clear owner, anyone who has a question about the project knows who to ask. This makes for clear, streamlined, cross-functional communication.",

You can also keep your projects humming along by tagging someone and including the deadline to complete a task. The best way to do this as a comment is to use the @ symbol to mention their name and the date on the same line.

Then tag them to ensure they provide feedback. If there will be multiple rounds of feedback and revisions, establish the exact number with your team before kicking off a project. This is especially helpful if you\u2019re an agency working to get sign off from clients on a final round of edits and need to avoid scope creep.\nSet a window for input \u2014 move projects forward faster by specifying a deadline for feedback as a top-of-page comment. You can also keep your projects humming along by tagging someone and including the deadline to complete a task. The best way to do this as a comment is to use the @ symbol to mention their name and the date on the same line. If they don\u2019t resolve the comment by that deadline, they\u2019ll receive a reminder as an update on their sidebar.\nGuide conversations \u2014 steer project discussions by leaving your own comments. Note what reviewers should be looking out for in your content. For example, if you want a product marketer\u2019s thoughts on positioning a new feature on your updated landing page, tag them in a specific section.\nNever miss a notification \u2014 turn on email or push notifications in the Settings & Members section of your sidebar.",

Notion unites company goals, team goals, and the work that supports them, centralizing your most vital information.\nHere\u2019s how we think about it: projects \u2192 initiatives \u2192 team goals \u2192 company goals.\nAfter establishing both company and team goals, we suggest making two databases: one for your team\u2019s roadmap and another for the projects that\u2019ll accomplish those goals.\nHere\u2019s how:",
            "Create a Table that\u2019s for your team\u2019s initiatives (this can be a page in your team's wiki). Call it \u201cRoadmap.\u201d\nCreate a column called \u201cCompany Goals\u201d using a Multi-select property, where each is a company goal. Do the same thing but this time, with \u201cTeam Goals.\u201d\nEvery row in the table will be its own initiative, each correlating to both company and team goals. For example, if your company goal is to increase revenue, your team goal could be to acquire more leads. The initiative might be to establish a referral program.\nAssign each of your initiatives a company goal and a team goal. This creates a line of sight from your team\u2019s work all the way to the company\u2019s goals.\nNow create a second Table. This will be for your team\u2019s projects, so call it \u201cProjects.\u201d\nThink about which specific projects can help accomplish these larger initiatives. For your initiative of establishing a referral program, projects might include: new email designs, creating an incentive structure, and establishing baseline metrics for success. Make each row in the table its own project.\nNow you\u2019re going to connect these two databases \u2014 so you can see all your goals, initiatives, and projects together. In your Roadmap, create a new Relation property. Locate your Projects database. Now you can begin assigning projects to the initiatives they support.",
            "Whenever you create a new project, simply add it to your Projects database \u2014 where you can assign it an initiative. That way, it\u2019ll automatically show up in your Roadmap too, so everything your team needs is in one place.\nAssign owners and timelines to set your plan in motion\nActionable work has clear owners and timelines. When teams jump between calendar apps, project management and work tools, things slip through the cracks. With Notion, your team can see everything in one place, putting the focus on execution.\nProperties help organize all the work you\u2019re doing. Here\u2019s how you can use them in each of your databases:\nIn your Roadmap:",
            "Add a Person property and assign an owner for each initiative.\nYou can add a Select property to assign a priority to all the goals. That way, you can prioritize what\u2019s most important first.\nUse another Select property to assign statuses to your goals, like \u201cBlocked,\u201d or \u201cIn progress,\u201d or \u201cPunted.\u201d\nSo you can see what\u2019s happening each quarter, create Multi-select properties (Q1, Q2, etc.). Because initiatives are bigger than projects, they may span multiple quarters.\nIn your Projects:",
            "Add a Person property and call it DRI (directly responsible individual), assigning one person to each project. You can also create a second Person property where you can tag anyone who the DRI is working with on that project.\nWith a Date property, you can designate a target launch date for each project. You can get even more granular by assigning each project an execution timeline. Add another Date property and this time, toggle on End date.\nUse a Select property for the status of your project. These can be things like \u201cNot started,\u201d \u201cPlanning,\u201d or \u201cDone.\u201d\nYou can further categorize your projects using another Select property to assign a \u201cType\u201d to each one. These can be things like \u201cLaunch,\u201d \u201cEmail campaign,\u201d or \u201cTeam-building.\u201d",
            "Having these properties in each of your tables gives you an instant download of what your team is working on \u2014 and everyone has clarity into what each other is working on. Goals give that high-level look. Projects get a little more granular. And because both are connected, you get a full line of sight across your entire organization \u2014 timelines, owners, and the goals you\u2019re working toward. This is great for building a culture of transparency and self-serve information.\nCreate custom database views that surface relevant information",
            "Setting a yearly plan can feel a bit intimidating. But custom views of your Roadmap and Projects databases give you the ability to bucket this information \u2014 whether that\u2019s projects you\u2019re working on this week or initiatives for the entire quarter.\nCustom database views allow your team to focus on what\u2019s important now, while maintaining that broader level of transparency for bigger initiatives or team-wide goals.\nHere are some views for your Roadmap:",

            "In your weekly 1:1s with direct reports, link a view of the Projects database showing only their projects for the quarter. Put this in your 1:1 template so it\u2019s included automatically every week. This is really useful for check-ins, questions, prioritization, and status updates on the report\u2019s work. And if you mark a project as complete, it\u2019s reflected in your master Projects database.\nIf you\u2019re hosting quarterly reviews, you can link a view of the Roadmap so everyone can see what\u2019s been accomplished that quarter. These reviews help shape your planning, with that hindsight providing invaluable foresight.\nAlign cross-functional teams. If your marketing team constantly collaborates with your sales team, you can create a view of the marketing Roadmap just for sales that lives in their wiki \u2014 so they can see all work relevant to them.\nIn your team wiki (or company wiki!), it\u2019s helpful to see all the work in motion for a specific week. This promotes transparency. Link a view of your Projects database at the top of your wiki, filtered by launch date \u2014 so no one misses anything important.",
            "Plan with clarity, execute with confidence\nSetting clear goals puts your team\u2019s work into focus. It\u2019s easy to get off track and lose that focus \u2014 but this system maintains the thread between the day-to-day and the big things you want to accomplish.\nIt\u2019s also extremely flexible, for when, inevitably, things come up along the way.

They allow teams to store diverse, complex information and customize how they see it.\nYou have several distinct types of databases \u2014 a table, board, calendar, etc. \u2014 all of which can be used as different views of a single database. This is helpful when you need to slice a large set of data in many ways.

            "When you have one large information set used by cross-functional teams \u2014 whether it\u2019s your roadmap or a company-wide list of tasks, different teams can create their own views of the database. That way, engineering can view their tasks without seeing all the marketing work as well.\nIf you have sub-teams as part of your team \u2014 if you have a table of engineering projects, each sub-team can have their own view, like one for the infrastructure team and one for the backend team. This fosters transparency, because there\u2019s visibility into what the entire engineering org is working on, but specific teams can choose to focus on their work.\nYour teams are juggling many projects at once \u2014 let\u2019s say your marketing team has a master list of everything they\u2019re working on.

You can also have a top-level page that\u2019s for everyone at the company, containing pages like \u201cMission and Values,\u201d \u201cBenefits,\u201d or \u201cVacation Policy.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t even have to click into these top-level pages to access their sub-pages.

            "You can create new pages in the sidebar by clicking the\u00a0+\u00a0next to workspace, shared, or private (depending on what you need). If you\u2019ve created a Meeting Notes database for the product team, you\u2019ll want to see this as a sub-page in the product team\u2019s homepage. So, just drag-and-drop your new page into the Product top-level page. It now lives there.\nHere are some tips from the Notion team to help you get the most out of your sidebar.",
            "Try hiding the sidebar for a clean, minimal page where you can focus on your work and eliminate distractions.\nTop-level pages in your workspace section should represent the overarching departments of your company. But at Notion, we also have company-wide Meeting Notes and Docs databases shared by everyone. We then use a series of tags to organize these by department or type of meeting/document. Learn more about team notes & docs.\nIt's a good rule of thumb to stick to a small number of top-level pages and file all your other pages and work inside of them. The toggles will always give you clear pathways to what you need.\nUse the private section to work solo before a page is ready for collaboration. With Notion\u2019s sharing and permissions settings on the top right of any page, you can add teammates to get their feedback or input. Once shared, the page then moves into the shared section of your sidebar. When it\u2019s ready for company-wide use, simply drag it into the workspace section.\nRotate your favorites depending on what you\u2019re working on at any given time. You might be executing a product launch for the month and need to reference that page frequently. But after that? Drag it into your archive and make space for the next project page.\nCreate an archive page where you can easily drag-and-drop old projects, finished work, and anything you no longer need but may want to reference later.",

Like a fingerprint, these assets should be the same everywhere your brand touches.\nA wiki is your design team\u2019s workshop. Yes, it\u2019s a place for all the tools your team needs to do excellent work. But it\u2019s also a place to initiate new team members into how you work. It\u2019s a place to archive past explorations, iterations and decisions. It\u2019s the fulcrum between design and every other team at the company.\nHere, we\u2019ll walk you through building your own design wiki in Notion (you might call it a knowledge base), and how it can unlock a better workflow for your team.\nIn this piece, you'll learn",
            "1How to create a wiki for your design team, step-by-step\n2How to customize it to match your team's needs\n3How to use features and integrations that are useful for design specifically\nHere's just one example of what your finished product could look like:\nHere's why your design team needs a wiki\nDesign work is a symphony of many instruments. The right typography. The right image. The right color (for the record, it\u2019s #030303, not #00000). If these assets are scattered around different apps or software, your team lacks a central source of truth, turning beautiful music into dissonant noise.\nYour design team deserves one reliable resource for:",

            "No wiki means inconsistent work \u2014 and when design work gets inconsistent, you end up diluting the brand you\u2019ve worked so hard to build. But it\u2019s not just the brand that suffers. Process suffers. You\u2019ve established a system that works for you and your team, and if it\u2019s not documented and accessible, that process won't get followed. At best, this slows everything down. At worst, it creates costly chaos.\nOne hub for everything creates a culture of self-service, allowing the product team or the marketing team to access things they\u2019d typically have to ask a designer for. Imagine how much time you\u2019d save if someone from sales could pop into your wiki and quickly find the correct logo they need for a pitch deck.",

It\u2019s important for the entire company.\nSetting up your design wiki\nLet\u2019s start with the basics and work our way up from there.\n1. Make a page\nAlmost everything you do in Notion starts with a page. Your design wiki will be a page that you'll add other pages to. These pages can contain just about anything \u2014 text, images, videos, databases and more.\nTo make a page, click the\u00a0+\u00a0button next to\u00a0WORKSPACE\u00a0on your left sidebar. If you're already inside of a page, hit\u00a0/\u00a0and type\u00a0page, then press enter.\nYour sidebar just got better",
            "While the information presented in this guide is still useful, some elements of the sidebar have been updated \u2014 making sharing with the right groups easier. Learn about how teamspaces give every team a home for their important work.\nWhenever you type\u00a0/, you'll see a dropdown menu full of content options \u2014 we call this a \"slash command.\" And as a designer, we think you'll end up using the slash command a lot to add different types of content to your pages.\nTemplates can help get you started\nClick to expand\n2. Nest sub-pages inside a page\nThe beauty of having a wiki is that it can contain main pages inside of it.",
            "That means you can have a page just for brand assets. You can have another for style guidelines. You can have one for team meeting notes, one for inspiration and even one that's a list of your favorite designers everyone should follow on Twitter.\nEach of these pages becomes a resource for your team or anyone who needs design materials, for that matter. And everything will be in one place, so you can spend less time searching high and low for the right files.",
            "Remember that, to make a page, you can type /page and press enter. Your new page will pop up, where you can give it a title and add any content. You can even add some personal flair to your pages by selecting the perfect emoji or cover art.\nIf you'd like to create many pages at once, you can list all of the pages you want to make as text. Select them all, then click the \u22ee\u22ee icon, which appears when you hover over the selection. Then click Turn Into and choose Page.\nSetting up a home for all your information obviously helps your work, but there are other downstream benefits to be had, too.",
            "Onboarding a new designer will never be so easy \u2014 they'll have your core design philosophies, documents, iterations and assets collected from day one. They can more quickly get spun up and start doing meaningful work since they have all the tools immediately. And they have this repository of information to return to whenever they need to understand past decisions and how to approach new projects.\nWith all assets centralized, keeping them fresh is simple. Instead of updating them several places, you can do it once in Notion. Nothing slips through the cracks because no cracks exist.\nYou and everyone on your design team know where the single source of truth is.\nYou can even add some personality to your pages\nClick to expand\n3.

Make a page\nThis is the starting point for just about everything you do in Notion. A page can contain anything \u2014 text, lists, videos, images, databases and more. Your wiki is a page you'll add other pages to.",

The \"Interviewer\" property is a person property that lets you tag your team members.\nTo view the information in your table as a board, click + Add a view at the top left. Select Board and give it a name.\nYou can also filter and sort the information in your table by using those buttons at the top right. You'll be prompted to choose which property you want to filter by. For example, let's say you only wanted to see user research sessions conducted by Doug. You can also create filtered views.

But a structured wiki is also helpful for someone on the community team who wants to see how many times a feature has been requested.

Databases can be good tools for collecting and structuring helpful data for your team, like user feedback, research, meeting notes and more.\nNotion makes it possible for all of this to live directly in your wiki. That way, knowledge informs your work and vice versa.\nThere are few different types of databases you can build in Notion: a\u00a0Table,\u00a0Board,\u00a0Gallery,\u00a0List, or\u00a0Calendar. We'll be focusing on the\u00a0Table\u00a0here, which, for example, you can use to catalog user research sessions where you've collected notes.",

You can open any individual session as its own Notion page, which can be structured however you want to capture what you learn.\nHere's how this could look (also showing how you can view the same information as a board):\nTo add this type of database to your product wiki:",
            "Add a sub-page, choose Table from the list of options, and title it \"User Research Database.\"\nCustomize your properties by clicking on each column header. This lets you choose what type of property you want to use, and also give it a name. For instance, the \"Task\" property above is a single select property that allows you to choose from a menu of tags you define. The \"Interviewer\" property is a person property that lets you tag your team members.\nTo view the information in your table as a board, click + Add a view at the top left. Select Board and give it a name.\nYou can also filter and sort the information in your table by using those buttons at the top right. You'll be prompted to choose which property you want to filter by. For example, let's say you only wanted to see user research sessions conducted by Doug. You can also create filtered views. First, add a new view, then apply a filter. You'll be able to toggle between this subset of data and your full table in an instant.",

A wiki that fosters better communication\nIf people have questions about anything on your wiki, they can comment or ask directly in Notion.\nYou can also tag anyone else in the organization to enable better cross-team collaboration, communication and transparency.

This is like a forum at the top of any page where you can discuss its contents.\nYou can also highlight any text to see the option to comment, or use the shortcut cmd/ctrl + shift + m to comment on anything.\nTo mention a teammate, simply type @ and start typing their name to pull them up.\nYou can hover over any block and comment that way, too. On the left, hit \u22ee\u22ee to get the full menu of options. Select Comment. The comment will then appear on the right of the block.",

Notion makes all this discourse visible and easy to respond to at any point. You don't have to worry about missing messages or needing to remember that one thing someone told you yesterday.\nEspecially when working remotely, Notion can make your team feel present together in their work, and make sure ideas, questions, and thoughts don't get lost in the hustle.\nSee it in action\nVisual learner?

Here's how to set it up, with recommendations specific to designers.\n1. One database tracks every initiative\nThere are a handful of different databases you can make in Notion: tables, calendars, lists, boards, etc. Here, we'll focus on a board \u2014 this is a collection of individual project pages you can move from one stage of your process to the next.",

Go ahead and change them to whatever you'd like \u2014 for example, \"Not started,\" \"Next up,\" \"In progress,\" and \"Completed.\"\nYou'll also see cards, which will be home to your design projects.

Customize your database\nUsing Notion, you can make a database that matches your team's workflow. Here are some tips for designers setting up their project management system.",
            "Add properties to your cards \u2014 inside your board's cards, you'll see properties. These are attributes you'll assign to each card, like the type of project or the designer responsible for it. Click on a property and you'll see a menu for the PROPERTY TYPE. Use a Person property to assign a designer (or project owner). Use a Select property and call it \"Type\" to denote the type of project, like ads, web or mobile. Use a Date property to select a ship date. You can add or remove as many properties as you'd like \u2014 so as your team changes or your process evolves, Notion grows with you.\nShow properties on your cards \u2014 to get a 10,000 ft. view of all the types of projects your team is working on, who's executing them, and their statuses, display certain properties directly on your cards. That way, you'll be able to see them in the board view (instead of needing to click into the specific card). At the top right of your table, hit \u2022\u2022\u2022 and select Properties. You'll then be able to toggle the properties you want to see in the board view. You can even grab the \u22ee\u22ee icon to re-order how they're shown on the cards.\nChange the grouping of your board \u2014 instead of seeing projects by their status, you might want to see them by priority, or see how many projects each designer has on their plate. On the upper right of your board, you'll see a Group by button. This changes the columns in the board to any property that's a Select, Multi-select or Person.\nCreate different views\u00a0\u2014 Notion allows you to view the same dataset many ways. Maybe you want to see all the projects related to landing pages, or maybe you want a calendar of launch dates. To do this, hit\u00a0+ Add a view\u00a0next to the title of your table, select the type of database you want, give it a name and hit\u00a0Create. You can then apply different filters and sorts to customize it further. Let's say you want a list of all the mobile projects your designers are working on. Create a list view, then select\u00a0Filter\u00a0and then\u00a0+ Add a filter. If you have a property that denotes the type of design work, choose \"Mobile\u201d and now, only mobile projects will be in your list. You can also select\u00a0Sort, then\u00a0+ Add a sort.

            "Like artists, designers use a unique combination of tools to get the job done. Notion consolidates them. No need to juggle design tools and the project management software just to get one thing done.",
            "Custom pages for every project \u2014 designers on your team probably work differently. No matter. The body of every Notion page can be used however they want, while still living inside the structure of your project management system. By typing /heading you can create headers to neatly organize info, making it easy to find and understand. You can drag-and-drop anything using the \u22ee\u22ee icon, like images, text, videos, whatever. Consider making columns for an even cleaner look by dragging blocks all the way to the right.\nEmbeds just for designers \u2014 Notion allows you to embed many different types of files right into your project pages. Of course, there's videos, images and PDFs. But you can also embed Figma or Invision projects to see live drafts of website mockups. Collaborate with the UX team on an app redesign by embedding Framer prototypes. In the final review of a logo change, an embedded Whimsical or Miro board could have a flowchart showing your designer's thought process. Access these by simply typing / and the name, like /figma or /miro.\nFeedback from all teams in one place\u00a0\u2014 design work is so cross-functional, you may be collaborating with engineers or getting approval from the head of marketing. Use the\u00a0@\u00a0symbol to mention one of your teammates and keep the feedback loop tight. This can be done at the top of any page by hovering over the title and clicking\u00a0Add discussion, or you can hover over any block to bring up the\u00a0\u22ee\u22ee\u00a0icon, and hit\u00a0Comment\u00a0from that menu. Collecting feedback from other pieces of software is difficult, leaving important thoughts on the studio floor. Notion busts the silos between teams while organizing relevant feedback from everyone in one place, making it actionable.",
            "Watch this\ud83d\udc47 4-minute video for everything on comments and discussions.\nIterations give decisions full context\u00a0\u2014 you can see what went into every design decision because drafts and commentary for that project are organized in one place. If you want to resurface a version of that mobile dropdown menu, or understand why the brand color changed from purple to periwinkle, you have a full field of vision from start to end of every single project.\nThis project management system pulls double duty, keeping your projects organized while centralizing all the work related to every project. Time spent hunting for information is reallocated to your craft.\n4. A template for every design process",
            "Set your designers off on the right foot by using templates \u2014 page formats that you can recreate inside your project management system with a single click.\nWhether it's a project kickoff or retrospective, templates help your designers approach problems with the same set of criteria.\u00a0Even broader, templates can help new designers get up to speed on your team's philosophy and provide important decision-making context for veterans and newbies alike.\nOn the right side of your board, click the down arrow next to the blue\u00a0New\u00a0button and select\u00a0+ New template. A blank page will appear. Here's where you'll create the template once so you can use it over and over again (you can also edit it, as your design process morphs).",
            "For designers specifically, here are a few ideas for templates:",
            "Project kickoff \u2014 under an \"Overview\" H2 header, you can have H3 headers for \"Problem Statement\" and \"Proposed Work.\" Then, under an H2 header for \"Scope,\" you can have H3 headers for \"Requirements,\" \"Timeline\" and \"Future Work.\" One thing we like to do is include prompts under these headers in a different color. Under \"Proposed Work,\" you can write a sentence that says, \"High-level overview of what we're building and why we think it will solve the problem.\" Change its color by clicking the \u22ee\u22ee icon and selecting Color from the menu.\nDesign spec \u2014 when sharing a mockup with your design team, using a template can ensure edge cases are considered and appropriate feedback is gathered. In the template, you can use a Select property to denote the type of work you're doing: \"Spec.\" You can even include other properties, like Date for proposed launch date or a Person to tag reviewers. In the body of the template, create H3 headers that give your team a space to embed the design, leave feedback, and outline next steps.\nClient presentation \u2014 if you're at an agency, you can share Notion pages with clients. This collates feedback into one place, instead of your designers digging through emails or Figma comments. Include H2 headers that neatly organize your design work, necessary context, and give clients a place for feedback. You can even include a Text property titled \"Summary\" and give clients the one-sentence rundown of the project's status. Then, when you're ready to share it, select Share from the top right of the page and toggle Share to the web. From the dropdown menu, toggle Allow comments, which will give your clients the ability to comment on your work. Then you're ready to hit Copy link and send it off.",
            "5. Best practices from Notion designers\nSam Baldwin is new to Notion's design team and from day one, he's been contributing. He says, \"Notion's project management system enabled me to quickly get up to speed with all the projects, priorities, and a sense of what everyone is working on. A shared tasks board promotes an open, transparent way of working. Anyone can weigh in on current projects or offer feedback, leading to better outcomes.\"\nHere are a few tips we've learned from our own design project management system:",
            "Linking project management systems between teams \u2014 if your engineering team is using Notion to organize their projects, you can link your two systems together so no one ever misses a beat.Add a Relation property to templates or pages in your board. Then search for your engineering team's project management database. So, if you're redesigning your website's homepage, you can link all the engineering tasks associated with that project, like code reviews and UX updates.You can use a Relation property to connect meeting notes too. No matter where other tasks or meeting notes are located in Notion, you can collect everything for a project in one place to help your team work more efficiently.\nPages where designers see only their tasks \u2014 many designers use individual pages to manage their own work. Inside these pages, you can link a specific view of your team-wide project management board. When a designer updates a task in their personal view, it's reflected in the team-wide project management board (and vice-versa).Type /link and select Create linked database. Search for your project management system and it'll appear right in that designer's page.Then + Add a view, using a Filter to surface only your tasks. This helps you focus while still working toward overall goals. You can also do this in your design wiki, creating a view that shows only projects in motion this week.\nTags or views for projects that are open for feedback \u2014 since Notion fosters transparency and collaboration between teams, we've created a tag that lets teammates know we'd like their opinions.In your project management board, create a Select property called \"Feedback,\" and make one of the tags \"RFC\" (request for comment).When you're kicking off a project or just mocked up a spec, you can tag the page RFC and circulate it with the entire team on Slack. That way, you can crowdsource feedback to make designs even stronger.",

By typing /heading you can create headers to neatly organize info, making it easy to find and understand. You can drag-and-drop anything using the \u22ee\u22ee icon, like images, text, videos, whatever. Consider making columns for an even cleaner look by dragging blocks all the way to the right.\nEmbeds just for designers \u2014 Notion allows you to embed many different types of files right into your project pages. Of course, there's videos, images and PDFs. But you can also embed Figma or Invision projects to see live drafts of website mockups. Collaborate with the UX team on an app redesign by embedding Framer prototypes. In the final review of a logo change, an embedded Whimsical or Miro board could have a flowchart showing your designer's thought process. Access these by simply typing / and the name, like /figma or /miro.\nFeedback from all teams in one place\u00a0\u2014 design work is so cross-functional, you may be collaborating with engineers or getting approval from the head of marketing. Use the\u00a0@\u00a0symbol to mention one of your teammates and keep the feedback loop tight. This can be done at the top of any page by hovering over the title and clicking\u00a0Add discussion, or you can hover over any block to bring up the\u00a0\u22ee\u22ee\u00a0icon, and hit\u00a0Comment\u00a0from that menu. Collecting feedback from other pieces of software is difficult, leaving important thoughts on the studio floor. Notion busts the silos between teams while organizing relevant feedback from everyone in one place, making it actionable.",
            "Watch this\ud83d\udc47 4-minute video for everything on comments and discussions.\nIterations give decisions full context\u00a0\u2014 you can see what went into every design decision because drafts and commentary for that project are organized in one place. If you want to resurface a version of that mobile dropdown menu, or understand why the brand color changed from purple to periwinkle, you have a full field of vision from start to end of every single project.\nThis project management system pulls double duty, keeping your projects organized while centralizing all the work related to every project. Time spent hunting for information is reallocated to your craft.\n4. A template for every design process",
            "Set your designers off on the right foot by using templates \u2014 page formats that you can recreate inside your project management system with a single click.\nWhether it's a project kickoff or retrospective, templates help your designers approach problems with the same set of criteria.\u00a0Even broader, templates can help new designers get up to speed on your team's philosophy and provide important decision-making context for veterans and newbies alike.\nOn the right side of your board, click the down arrow next to the blue\u00a0New\u00a0button and select\u00a0+ New template. A blank page will appear. Here's where you'll create the template once so you can use it over and over again (you can also edit it, as your design process morphs).",
            "For designers specifically, here are a few ideas for templates:",
            "Project kickoff \u2014 under an \"Overview\" H2 header, you can have H3 headers for \"Problem Statement\" and \"Proposed Work.\" Then, under an H2 header for \"Scope,\" you can have H3 headers for \"Requirements,\" \"Timeline\" and \"Future Work.\" One thing we like to do is include prompts under these headers in a different color. Under \"Proposed Work,\" you can write a sentence that says, \"High-level overview of what we're building and why we think it will solve the problem.\" Change its color by clicking the \u22ee\u22ee icon and selecting Color from the menu.\nDesign spec \u2014 when sharing a mockup with your design team, using a template can ensure edge cases are considered and appropriate feedback is gathered. In the template, you can use a Select property to denote the type of work you're doing: \"Spec.\" You can even include other properties, like Date for proposed launch date or a Person to tag reviewers. In the body of the template, create H3 headers that give your team a space to embed the design, leave feedback, and outline next steps.\nClient presentation \u2014 if you're at an agency, you can share Notion pages with clients. This collates feedback into one place, instead of your designers digging through emails or Figma comments. Include H2 headers that neatly organize your design work, necessary context, and give clients a place for feedback. You can even include a Text property titled \"Summary\" and give clients the one-sentence rundown of the project's status. Then, when you're ready to share it, select Share from the top right of the page and toggle Share to the web. From the dropdown menu, toggle Allow comments, which will give your clients the ability to comment on your work. Then you're ready to hit Copy link and send it off.",
            "5. Best practices from Notion designers\nSam Baldwin is new to Notion's design team and from day one, he's been contributing. He says, \"Notion's project management system enabled me to quickly get up to speed with all the projects, priorities, and a sense of what everyone is working on. A shared tasks board promotes an open, transparent way of working. Anyone can weigh in on current projects or offer feedback, leading to better outcomes.\"\nHere are a few tips we've learned from our own design project management system:",
            "Linking project management systems between teams \u2014 if your engineering team is using Notion to organize their projects, you can link your two systems together so no one ever misses a beat.Add a Relation property to templates or pages in your board. Then search for your engineering team's project management database. So, if you're redesigning your website's homepage, you can link all the engineering tasks associated with that project, like code reviews and UX updates.You can use a Relation property to connect meeting notes too. No matter where other tasks or meeting notes are located in Notion, you can collect everything for a project in one place to help your team work more efficiently.\nPages where designers see only their tasks \u2014 many designers use individual pages to manage their own work. Inside these pages, you can link a specific view of your team-wide project management board. When a designer updates a task in their personal view, it's reflected in the team-wide project management board (and vice-versa).Type /link and select Create linked database. Search for your project management system and it'll appear right in that designer's page.Then + Add a view, using a Filter to surface only your tasks. This helps you focus while still working toward overall goals. You can also do this in your design wiki, creating a view that shows only projects in motion this week.\nTags or views for projects that are open for feedback \u2014 since Notion fosters transparency and collaboration between teams, we've created a tag that lets teammates know we'd like their opinions.In your project management board, create a Select property called \"Feedback,\" and make one of the tags \"RFC\" (request for comment).When you're kicking off a project or just mocked up a spec, you can tag the page RFC and circulate it with the entire team on Slack. That way, you can crowdsource feedback to make designs even stronger.",

            "Show properties in your board view \u2014 to understand what's going on with your candidates and new hires at a glance, you can display them right on the cards in your board. Instead of needing to click into a card to see an applicant's location or the hiring manager, you can see all that info right from the board view.

            "The role they're filling \u2014 a Select property where you can designate what team this person will be joining, from product to customer support.\nTheir contact \u2014 an Email or Phone property so you don't have to dig through your inbox to quickly and easily touch base with them.\nWebsite \u2014 a Website property for their personal website, so anyone on the team can review samples, design work and anything else.\nSkills \u2014 a Multi-select property where you can create any number of tags based on their skills, like \"Front End\" or \"UX\" for an engineer.\nSource of the application\u00a0\u2014 whether it's a referral, a cold inbound or a warm intro, you can use a\u00a0Select\u00a0property to track where you're getting the most leads.With such an ocean of applicants, custom views act like a net so you're surfacing only what's relevant right here and now. Try these:\nBy team\u00a0\u2014 a table view of candidates by team, like engineering or marketing.\nBy hiring manager \u2014 a board view where each column is a different hiring manager, and all the roles they're responsible for are pages filed underneath.\nBy source \u2014 with many applicants in the pipe, it can be beneficial to see where they're coming from. This board view, where columns are organized by source, helps with that.\nA calendar of start dates \u2014 a calendar view so you can see when candidates are starting.",
            "More properties & views for your New Hire Onboarding\nProperties help create visibility into the onboarding process, both for new hires and for teammates responsible for certain steps in the process. Here are a few we like:",
            "Their department \u2014 a Select property where you'll include the department this new team member is joining.\nStart date \u2014 with a Date property, you can assign a start date for new employees. This helps with scheduling check-ins down the road, like at 90 days or one year.\nPutting a face to the name \u2014 with a Files & media property, you can include a photo of your new hire so existing team members can get to know them more personally.\nFun facts\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0Text\u00a0property where the new employee can include a fun fact about themselves, like if they think a hotdog is a sandwich or not.Views are important so you can see where everyone's at in the onboarding process, no matter what department they're part of or when they started. These might be helpful:\nBy team\u00a0\u2014 a board where the columns are different departments and new hires are slotted in each one. You can also create custom views for each team to see only additions to that team.\nBy start date \u2014 a table of all teammates, organized with the newest start date at the top.\nBy onboarding status \u2014 a board where columns are different statuses, so you can see where each new employee is in the onboarding funnel, and what's left to do.",
            "3. Every page can be customized\nIn Notion, customization is like an onion. It can be high-level, like changing columns in a board to match your onboarding process. Or it can be granular, where the pages nested in these columns are personalized to every candidate.\nFor instance, you might want to create a page for an engineering onsite interview, with information about the day's structure. Or you can share specific tools used by the engineering team in an onboarding page. These allow you to develop a completely custom experience for every potential or existing employee \u2014 that kind of thing doesn't go unnoticed.",
            "Headers \u2014 to give each page a clean and tidy look, consider adding different sized headers to organize your information. Choose from H1 (the largest), H2 or H3. When prepping your hiring manager for an interview with an engineering candidate, you can include an H1 header for \"Prep\" with H2 headers underneath for \"Background Info\" and \"Skills Criteria.\" This makes downloading information much easier for someone pitching in on an interview.\nDrag-and-drop \u2014 using the \u22ee\u22ee icon, move anything around your pages. Pages inside pages, text, images, just about anything can be organized however you'd like. You can even grab headers and drag them all the way to the right (the blue guides will help) to create columns. That way, you can have \"Interview Questions\" on a left column and \"Call Notes\" on the right for easy reference.",
            "You can take customization even further with Notion's embeds. These open up a world of possibilities for what can be included in a page. Here's what might be useful to your team:\nWorking with co-workers during the interview process? Check out this 4-minute video that teaches you everything you need to know about comments and discussions.\nFor applicant tracking\nWhether it's internal pages so your team can review an application, or an external page you're sharing with a candidate, certain embeds help unite all relevant pieces of information. To access these embeds, simply type\u00a0/\u00a0and its name. For example\u00a0/image\u00a0or\u00a0/map.",
            "Sample work \u2014 instead of needing to leave your Applicant Tracker to review materials, Notion brings them all together. For designers, embed prototypes from Figma, Invision, Miro and more. For engineers, you can work together in code blocks, or embed GitHub gists.\nPDFs & other files \u2014 resumes for internal reviewers, style guides if the applicant is working on a project, etc. Just type /embed and paste the share link to embed from 500+ apps.\nMaps\u00a0\u2014 when hosting an onsite interview, you can embed the location of your office from Google Maps right inside the applicant's custom prep page they receive in advance.\nWant to share public pages with applicants? Watch this 4-minute video\nFor new hire onboarding",
            "Every team has unique onboarding needs. When bringing on a new teammate, you can customize the experience based on which team they're joining. To include these embeds, type\u00a0/todo,\u00a0/link\u00a0and\u00a0/web.",
            "A to-do list so you know what's complete \u2014 few things are as satisfying as checking something off a to-do list. You can include a list in a new hire's onboarding materials so they know what they need to complete (and you get transparency into what they've done so far).\nLink to internal pages \u2014 whether it's a company wiki, a lunch-ordering system, or any other materials you already have that this new hire will need, you can link to them inside their onboarding page for quick reference.\nWeb bookmarks for external pages \u2014 things like benefits information, vacation and expense policies, etc. usually live across many websites. These can all be included in onboarding pages by linking to external websites or even embedding PDFs right inside the page.",
            "4. Standardize your process with templates\nFrom an applicant tracking perspective, templates help your team operate off the same set of principles, questions, and assessments. For onboarding, templates can speed up your process so you're not reinventing the wheel every time that, say, a new marketer or designer joins.\nBy setting the framework, you're creating a consistent experience. Yes, that's essential for streamlining the growth your team. But it's also essential for doing so with quality, equity, and care \u2014 especially as your cadence hits warp-speed.",
            "To create a template in either of your databases, click the down arrow next to the blue\u00a0New\u00a0button. Then select\u00a0+ New template. A blank page will come up. This is your template that you can format and then use any time you want.\nTemplates for your Applicant Tracker",
            "New candidate interview \u2014 under an H2 header for \"Notes,\" you can include several toggles for feedback from different interviewers. On any blank line, type > and a toggle will come up. Title each based on your review system, and inside, interviewers can leave their notes. This keeps all candidate notes reference-able without being overwhelming or immediately viewable. Under these, you can even include H2 headers for \"References\" and \"Next Steps.\"\nInterview rubric \u2014 inside your interview pages, you can also include a rubric so everyone on your team is evaluating every candidate the same way. Type /table and choose Table - Inline. Here you can make the first column all the different things you'll grade a candidate on, from \"Skills assessment\" to \"Culture fit.\" Make the second column a Number property type, where you can assign a 1 - 5 based on each criteria. Then, turn the third column into a Text property where you can leave some notes to expand on your ratings.\nAssigning team-specific projects \u2014 as your team grows, you'll probably be assigning many projects to candidates. You can create some team-specific templates, like a coding exercise for engineers or a writing assignment for copywriters. Then provide the hiring team with some prompts for analyzing these assignments. Under an H2 header for \"Notes,\" tag the reviewers using the @ symbol and add a few bullets about what they should be looking for when going through test work.",
            "Templates for your New Hire Onboarding",
            "Team-specific materials \u2014 along with a custom welcome note, you can include all the materials new teammates will need to start their journey with your company. Make one for each of your teams. H2 headers can include \"Basics,\" \"HR & Benefits,\" and \"Tools\" (which should be specific to the team). It's also nice to include checkboxes under each of these so you know when they've been set up. To make them, type [] on any blank line.\n30-day check-in \u2014 it's important to touch base with new employees, answer questions and make sure they're getting early feedback from their managers. In their onboarding doc, you can create a new page titled \"30-Day Check-In.\" Inside this page, use the @ symbol and type @remind aug25. This will remind you to set up the check-in (you'll get a notification). Also inside the page, you can create H2 sections where managers, teammates and the employee themselves can provide feedback for total transparency.",

Best practices from the Notion hiring team\nOur internal applicant tracking and onboarding systems set the foundation for experiences that potential and existing employees have with our company. They\u2019re tools integral to our ability to scale \u2014 they help us connect with people and help the people at Notion connect with each other.\nThere are so many pieces needed to hire and onboard efficiently. These systems put that puzzle together for us. Here are our favorites:",
            "Create a company directory \u2014 a directory of all employees helps us get to know each other a little better, which is especially important in the era of remote work. It's a database with table and gallery views (see image above) that includes our Notion illustrated portraits, personal websites and emails, the teams we're on, and even things like office pets. Using a Formula property, we even show everyone's tenure in months and years. The table is sorted from newest employee to earliest.Inside these employee pages are what we call \"Life Stories.\" Each week, someone new makes a presentation about their life \u2014 it's one of our most valued cultural touchstones keeping us all bonded. These are all saved so new employees can go through and learn more about their coworkers (and see a number of baby photos along the way \ud83d\ude09).\nA new hire newsletter \u2014 as with any rapidly-growing team, it can be difficult to stay updated on all the new faces. To help with this, our recruiters put out a new hire newsletter with updates on who's joined, which roles are open, and any other important HR info. We use a gallery database (which you can make by typing /gallery) to show employees' photos to everyone on the team. In the Share menu on the top right of the page, we use Copy link to circulate this newsletter via Slack to the entire company.\nMake a job board \u2014 of course we post jobs at Notion using a job board ... in Notion. You can use this job board template to get started, which will include open positions and give applicants a sense of what life is like at your company. It's a series of list databases, one for each team, where pages contain job descriptions and instructions to apply. Using this is a quick way to spin up an instantly editable jobs site without the pains of web development.",

            "Their department \u2014 a Select property where you'll include the department this new team member is joining.\nStart date \u2014 with a Date property, you can assign a start date for new employees. This helps with scheduling check-ins down the road, like at 90 days or one year.\nPutting a face to the name \u2014 with a Files & media property, you can include a photo of your new hire so existing team members can get to know them more personally.\nFun facts\u00a0\u2014 a\u00a0Text\u00a0property where the new employee can include a fun fact about themselves, like if they think a hotdog is a sandwich or not.Views are important so you can see where everyone's at in the onboarding process, no matter what department they're part of or when they started. These might be helpful:\nBy team\u00a0\u2014 a board where the columns are different departments and new hires are slotted in each one. You can also create custom views for each team to see only additions to that team.\nBy start date \u2014 a table of all teammates, organized with the newest start date at the top.\nBy onboarding status \u2014 a board where columns are different statuses, so you can see where each new employee is in the onboarding funnel, and what's left to do.",
            "3. Every page can be customized\nIn Notion, customization is like an onion. It can be high-level, like changing columns in a board to match your onboarding process. Or it can be granular, where the pages nested in these columns are personalized to every candidate.\nFor instance, you might want to create a page for an engineering onsite interview, with information about the day's structure. Or you can share specific tools used by the engineering team in an onboarding page. These allow you to develop a completely custom experience for every potential or existing employee \u2014 that kind of thing doesn't go unnoticed.",
            "Headers \u2014 to give each page a clean and tidy look, consider adding different sized headers to organize your information. Choose from H1 (the largest), H2 or H3. When prepping your hiring manager for an interview with an engineering candidate, you can include an H1 header for \"Prep\" with H2 headers underneath for \"Background Info\" and \"Skills Criteria.\" This makes downloading information much easier for someone pitching in on an interview.\nDrag-and-drop \u2014 using the \u22ee\u22ee icon, move anything around your pages. Pages inside pages, text, images, just about anything can be organized however you'd like. You can even grab headers and drag them all the way to the right (the blue guides will help) to create columns. That way, you can have \"Interview Questions\" on a left column and \"Call Notes\" on the right for easy reference.",
            "You can take customization even further with Notion's embeds. These open up a world of possibilities for what can be included in a page. Here's what might be useful to your team:\nWorking with co-workers during the interview process? Check out this 4-minute video that teaches you everything you need to know about comments and discussions.\nFor applicant tracking\nWhether it's internal pages so your team can review an application, or an external page you're sharing with a candidate, certain embeds help unite all relevant pieces of information. To access these embeds, simply type\u00a0/\u00a0and its name. For example\u00a0/image\u00a0or\u00a0/map.",
            "Sample work \u2014 instead of needing to leave your Applicant Tracker to review materials, Notion brings them all together. For designers, embed prototypes from Figma, Invision, Miro and more. For engineers, you can work together in code blocks, or embed GitHub gists.\nPDFs & other files \u2014 resumes for internal reviewers, style guides if the applicant is working on a project, etc. Just type /embed and paste the share link to embed from 500+ apps.\nMaps\u00a0\u2014 when hosting an onsite interview, you can embed the location of your office from Google Maps right inside the applicant's custom prep page they receive in advance.\nWant to share public pages with applicants? Watch this 4-minute video\nFor new hire onboarding",
            "Every team has unique onboarding needs. When bringing on a new teammate, you can customize the experience based on which team they're joining. To include these embeds, type\u00a0/todo,\u00a0/link\u00a0and\u00a0/web.",
            "A to-do list so you know what's complete \u2014 few things are as satisfying as checking something off a to-do list. You can include a list in a new hire's onboarding materials so they know what they need to complete (and you get transparency into what they've done so far).\nLink to internal pages \u2014 whether it's a company wiki, a lunch-ordering system, or any other materials you already have that this new hire will need, you can link to them inside their onboarding page for quick reference.\nWeb bookmarks for external pages \u2014 things like benefits information, vacation and expense policies, etc. usually live across many websites. These can all be included in onboarding pages by linking to external websites or even embedding PDFs right inside the page.",
            "4. Standardize your process with templates\nFrom an applicant tracking perspective, templates help your team operate off the same set of principles, questions, and assessments. For onboarding, templates can speed up your process so you're not reinventing the wheel every time that, say, a new marketer or designer joins.\nBy setting the framework, you're creating a consistent experience. Yes, that's essential for streamlining the growth your team. But it's also essential for doing so with quality, equity, and care \u2014 especially as your cadence hits warp-speed.",
            "To create a template in either of your databases, click the down arrow next to the blue\u00a0New\u00a0button. Then select\u00a0+ New template. A blank page will come up. This is your template that you can format and then use any time you want.\nTemplates for your Applicant Tracker",
            "New candidate interview \u2014 under an H2 header for \"Notes,\" you can include several toggles for feedback from different interviewers. On any blank line, type > and a toggle will come up. Title each based on your review system, and inside, interviewers can leave their notes. This keeps all candidate notes reference-able without being overwhelming or immediately viewable. Under these, you can even include H2 headers for \"References\" and \"Next Steps.\"\nInterview rubric \u2014 inside your interview pages, you can also include a rubric so everyone on your team is evaluating every candidate the same way. Type /table and choose Table - Inline. Here you can make the first column all the different things you'll grade a candidate on, from \"Skills assessment\" to \"Culture fit.\" Make the second column a Number property type, where you can assign a 1 - 5 based on each criteria. Then, turn the third column into a Text property where you can leave some notes to expand on your ratings.\nAssigning team-specific projects \u2014 as your team grows, you'll probably be assigning many projects to candidates. You can create some team-specific templates, like a coding exercise for engineers or a writing assignment for copywriters. Then provide the hiring team with some prompts for analyzing these assignments. Under an H2 header for \"Notes,\" tag the reviewers using the @ symbol and add a few bullets about what they should be looking for when going through test work.",
            "Templates for your New Hire Onboarding",
            "Team-specific materials \u2014 along with a custom welcome note, you can include all the materials new teammates will need to start their journey with your company. Make one for each of your teams. H2 headers can include \"Basics,\" \"HR & Benefits,\" and \"Tools\" (which should be specific to the team). It's also nice to include checkboxes under each of these so you know when they've been set up. To make them, type [] on any blank line.\n30-day check-in \u2014 it's important to touch base with new employees, answer questions and make sure they're getting early feedback from their managers. In their onboarding doc, you can create a new page titled \"30-Day Check-In.\" Inside this page, use the @ symbol and type @remind aug25. This will remind you to set up the check-in (you'll get a notification). Also inside the page, you can create H2 sections where managers, teammates and the employee themselves can provide feedback for total transparency.",
            "5. Best practices from the Notion hiring team\nOur internal applicant tracking and onboarding systems set the foundation for experiences that potential and existing employees have with our company. They\u2019re tools integral to our ability to scale \u2014 they help us connect with people and help the people at Notion connect with each other.\nThere are so many pieces needed to hire and onboard efficiently. These systems put that puzzle together for us. Here are our favorites:",
            "Create a company directory \u2014 a directory of all employees helps us get to know each other a little better, which is especially important in the era of remote work. It's a database with table and gallery views (see image above) that includes our Notion illustrated portraits, personal websites and emails, the teams we're on, and even things like office pets. Using a Formula property, we even show everyone's tenure in months and years. The table is sorted from newest employee to earliest.Inside these employee pages are what we call \"Life Stories.\" Each week, someone new makes a presentation about their life \u2014 it's one of our most valued cultural touchstones keeping us all bonded. These are all saved so new employees can go through and learn more about their coworkers (and see a number of baby photos along the way \ud83d\ude09).\nA new hire newsletter \u2014 as with any rapidly-growing team, it can be difficult to stay updated on all the new faces. To help with this, our recruiters put out a new hire newsletter with updates on who's joined, which roles are open, and any other important HR info. We use a gallery database (which you can make by typing /gallery) to show employees' photos to everyone on the team. In the Share menu on the top right of the page, we use Copy link to circulate this newsletter via Slack to the entire company.\nMake a job board \u2014 of course we post jobs at Notion using a job board ... in Notion. You can use this job board template to get started, which will include open positions and give applicants a sense of what life is like at your company. It's a series of list databases, one for each team, where pages contain job descriptions and instructions to apply. Using this is a quick way to spin up an instantly editable jobs site without the pains of web development.",

Everyone at your company will be able to join teamspaces that are relevant to their role, and structure their sidebar to best fit their individual working needs. As an admin, you\u2019ll have some additional security and provisioning settings to consider that can be customized with each teamspace.\nIf you previously operated in a workspace without teamspaces, here\u2019s what to expect when the feature is turned on for you. All pages in the workspace section will become pages in a \u201cgeneral\u201d teamspace and you\u2019ll be free to move and create additional teamspaces as you see fit. In this guide we\u2019ll discuss why and how to create new teamspaces.",
            "Precisely control permissions and access\nThe first decision you will have to make as a workspace owner is who should be able to create teamspaces. By default, any members in your workspace (not guests) can create new teamspaces. You can change this setting with the \u201cLimit teamspace creation to only workspace owners\u201d toggle. Toggling this option won\u2019t affect any existing teamspaces.\nDepending on how your organization approaches content management and provisioning, you may have different considerations for whether or not to allow members to create teamspaces.\nHere\u2019s some general rules for when to allow all members create teamspaces (keep the default):",
            "You prefer to let your employees move nimbly and set up their own structures\nLimiting teamspace creation to only workspace owners would create a bottleneck in your workflows\nHowever, you may consider limiting teamspace creation to workspace owners if any of the following apply to you:\nYou want more oversight over changes in your Notion instance\nYou want to have a centralized plan for teamspaces",
            "You can find settings and more information in Settings & Members, under the tab Teamspaces. Here, you\u2019ll be able to see and update which teamspaces are the default for new members to join. We recommend only having 1-3 teamspaces as default \u2014 only content that is truly necessary for every employee at your company. As you create more teamspaces, this is where you will be able to see a list of information about each of them.\nGive every team member the right level of access",
            "Teamspaces create a new layer of access to provision content to individual members of your workspace. They let you be more specific about who from your organization is able to access content in Notion, and with what level of permission. Each teamspace has a list of members and at least one owner, and you can set permission levels to content on a per-teamspace basis.",
            "This will look different in each workspace, but here\u2019s an example. If you create a Marketing teamspace, you can give all members of the teamspace Can Edit access, and give all other members of the workspace Can View access. By default, teamspace owners have Full Access to all content within the teamspace. Now any content you add to the Marketing teamspace will inherit these permission settings, with no further action needed on your part.\nTeamspaces can help answer some of these questions you might have come across previously as a Notion admin. Here\u2019s a few instances where granular permissions might make sense for your organization.",
            "Automatically provision content for new hires \u2014 Once configured, SCIM will let you automatically add new hires to the relevant teamspaces via groups, making it easy for them to find the content they need on day one.\nDecrease \u201cshared page\u201d clutter \u2014 Some work is too sensitive to be shared broadly, resulting in a messy shared section of one-off pages. A closed or private teamspace with the relevant stakeholders is a good way to keep a boundary around sensitive content while maintaining organizational structure.\nIncrease view-only access to important company information \u2014 When your tools are too siloed, it\u2019s impossible to find the information you need from a different team. Converting team working documents with varied permission levels into open teamspaces allows everyone to search for and view the content, while giving editors and managers the level of freedom they need.\nPrevent accidental permissions changes \u2014 One teamspace might allow members to create public pages, while another doesn\u2019t. This prevents sensitive information from accidentally being switched to public, while keeping it visible to your whole org.",

            "If you already have top-level pages for functional areas, office locations, or employee resource groups, that\u2019s a great place to start. You can turn each of those top-level pages into a teamspace. Just hover over the page in the sidebar and click on the \u2026 icon and you\u2019ll see a new option: Turn into teamspace.

            "Workspace owner\u2019s guide to teamspaces\nTeamspaces give you more customizability and control over access levels to content, functioning like smaller workspaces within your workspace. Everyone at your company will be able to join teamspaces that are relevant to their role, and structure their sidebar to best fit their individual working needs. As an admin, you\u2019ll have some additional security and provisioning settings to consider that can be customized with each teamspace.",
            "If you previously operated in a workspace without teamspaces, here\u2019s what to expect when the feature is turned on for you. All pages in the workspace section will become pages in a \u201cgeneral\u201d teamspace and you\u2019ll be free to move and create additional teamspaces as you see fit. In this guide we\u2019ll discuss why and how to create new teamspaces.\nPrecisely control permissions and access\nThe first decision you will have to make as a workspace owner is who should be able to create teamspaces. By default, any members in your workspace (not guests) can create new teamspaces. You can change this setting with the \u201cLimit teamspace creation to only workspace owners\u201d toggle. Toggling this option won\u2019t affect any existing teamspaces.",
            "Depending on how your organization approaches content management and provisioning, you may have different considerations for whether or not to allow members to create teamspaces.\nHere\u2019s some general rules for when to allow all members create teamspaces (keep the default):\nYou prefer to let your employees move nimbly and set up their own structures\nLimiting teamspace creation to only workspace owners would create a bottleneck in your workflows\nHowever, you may consider limiting teamspace creation to workspace owners if any of the following apply to you:\nYou want more oversight over changes in your Notion instance\nYou want to have a centralized plan for teamspaces",
            "You can find settings and more information in Settings & Members, under the tab Teamspaces. Here, you\u2019ll be able to see and update which teamspaces are the default for new members to join. We recommend only having 1-3 teamspaces as default \u2014 only content that is truly necessary for every employee at your company. As you create more teamspaces, this is where you will be able to see a list of information about each of them.\nGive every team member the right level of access",
            "Teamspaces create a new layer of access to provision content to individual members of your workspace. They let you be more specific about who from your organization is able to access content in Notion, and with what level of permission. Each teamspace has a list of members and at least one owner, and you can set permission levels to content on a per-teamspace basis.",
            "This will look different in each workspace, but here\u2019s an example. If you create a Marketing teamspace, you can give all members of the teamspace Can Edit access, and give all other members of the workspace Can View access. By default, teamspace owners have Full Access to all content within the teamspace. Now any content you add to the Marketing teamspace will inherit these permission settings, with no further action needed on your part.\nTeamspaces can help answer some of these questions you might have come across previously as a Notion admin. Here\u2019s a few instances where granular permissions might make sense for your organization.",
            "Automatically provision content for new hires \u2014 Once configured, SCIM will let you automatically add new hires to the relevant teamspaces via groups, making it easy for them to find the content they need on day one.\nDecrease \u201cshared page\u201d clutter \u2014 Some work is too sensitive to be shared broadly, resulting in a messy shared section of one-off pages. A closed or private teamspace with the relevant stakeholders is a good way to keep a boundary around sensitive content while maintaining organizational structure.\nIncrease view-only access to important company information \u2014 When your tools are too siloed, it\u2019s impossible to find the information you need from a different team. Converting team working documents with varied permission levels into open teamspaces allows everyone to search for and view the content, while giving editors and managers the level of freedom they need.\nPrevent accidental permissions changes \u2014 One teamspace might allow members to create public pages, while another doesn\u2019t. This prevents sensitive information from accidentally being switched to public, while keeping it visible to your whole org.",

Plus, you\u2019ll be able to automatically provision the right content to the right people by using SCIM in combination with teamspaces.",

Instead of needing to jump between tools and waste time context-switching, here\u2019s how you can bring information into Notion.\nEmbed complementary tools",
            "Easily embed tools that help enrich Notion pages, so you can tell a complete story. You can embed virtually any online content within Notion pages \u2014 from video and audio players to Figma and Invision mockups, to entire Google documents and spreadsheets. This includes streaming multimedia, PDFs, forms, and interactive maps.\nDesigners can embed Figma files into Notion for the marketing team\u2019s feedback. HR can embed Google Maps into a new hire\u2019s welcome page in Notion. Product teams can even embed Typeforms to survey users in Notion. This centralizes information and reduces the need to constantly switch tools and tabs when collaborating cross-functionally.\nIntegrate collaborative tools",
            "Using our API, link previews help turn Notion into the central organizing hub of your tool ecosystem. They embed real-time, synced visualizations of external tools \u2014 without having to leave Notion.\nAll you have to do is paste a link from Jira, Slack, Asana, Trello, or GitHub, and a preview is generated with real-time information fetched directly from the link. Link previews gather information from other tools so you can collaborate with cross-functional teams and make quick decisions inside one Notion workspace. This means you can access Jira, GitHub, and Slack from Notion to gain back time lost context switching.",
            "For example, we know that many engineering teams use tools like Jira and Asana to manage their product roadmap, track bugs, see their backlog, create reports, and more.\nBut other teams outside engineering often don\u2019t have insight into these statuses. Instead, they\u2019re left to send Slack messages or emails, asking engineers if the work is complete. If you\u2019re using a page in Notion to track the status of bug fixes and product updates for a project, ask your engineering team to post Jira link previews inside the page so other teams know exactly when issues are fixed.\nThis makes information more accessible to all, helping align teams without meetings, pings, or rooting around.\nThis allows teams to:",
            "Build faster knowing the status of product features \u2014 when all information lives in Notion, that saves your team time from searching for information or statuses (so they can spend time building).\nBuild a granular project management system \u2014 unite all aspects of your project into a single project management system, so you\u2019re not chasing around disparate pieces of valuable information.\nAlign with external collaborators \u2014 link previews gives external collaborators all the information they need to execute. Everyone is aligned on statuses and action items without needing to manage more access controls.\nNotion complements and enhances other tools\nUnderstanding how Notion fits into your toolstack helps you get the most out of it.",
            "Notion is great for async communication (and has been referred to as \u201cthe other half of Slack\u201d) because of how you can organize and easily access information in documents. But Notion also pulls together all your other tools too \u2014 and when information lives in one place, it saves your team time searching for what they need to execute.\nConsolidation opportunities with Notion\nIf you use tools for any of the following use-cases, you can consider consolidating them in Notion for a more connected workspace experience.",

            "Database templates allow you to pre-populate pages in a database, like your weekly sync meeting notes. Every heading, prompt, and bullet point is outlined and ready to go. You can even tag the folks who always attend, and label it with the right category.\nWithout repeating templates, someone still needs to remember to create that entry every time, and with so much work on your plate, anything that saves energy (and cut down on clicks) is a bonus.\nNow imagine a task one of your team members has to do every Monday morning. Do you create a new entry into your team\u2019s \u201cTasks\u201d database every week? Or, once they\u2019ve completed the task, do they move it back into the \u201cTo Do\u201d column and change the due date?",
            "Both of these approaches work, but can be slightly cumbersome, and there\u2019s a risk of tasks getting forgotten.\nWith repeating database templates, you now only have to create a template for a task, meeting or document once. Then, you can set it up to repeat as often as you need, and the item will automatically be created in the database. All that\u2019s left to do is fill it out or check it off.\nHow to create repeating templates in a database\nTo create a repeating template in a database, first create a database template as your normally would - go to the dropdown next to \u201cNew\u201d, select \u201c+ New template\u201d, and start editing your page.",
            "Then, click \u201c...\u201d next to your new template in the dropdown menu. Select \u201cRepeat\u201d, and choose how often you want an entry to be created from the template. You can choose every day, week, month or year, or go to \u201cCustom\u201d. Here, you can customize the repeating frequency further, and choose whether you want your repeating template to appear every 3 days, on Tuesday and Thursday every week, or every 2 months, for example.",
            "Once you\u2019ve selected your frequency a new item will appear in the database, based on your template, when the time comes. You can turn any of your existing templates into repeating templates by following the same process. If you ever want to stop a repeating template, you can either delete the template entirely, or go to the template options and turn \u201cRepeat\u201d off.\nUse repeating templates in many different ways with your team\nRepeating database templates can speed up and standardize your work, so you can spend more time on your most important jobs, and less time on tedious administrative tasks.\nYou can use them in many different ways to automate a lot of your project management work.",

Instead, you can just focus on getting them done.\nUse recurring docs for weekly summaries, project updates and more",
            "You might find yourself creating documents summarizing the status of all your current projects, or provide general team updates, every week. You always do this at the same time every week and use the same format to draft the doc.\nThis is a perfect opportunity to use a repeating template. Create a repeating template for your document with headers, bullets and text blocks ready so all you have to do is fill in key information.

            "You and your team may have seen Notion pages and wondered, \u201cHow can we build something like that?\u201d\nEverything in a Notion page is a block. And after you get the hang of using blocks, building and customizing pages gets easier because you have a whole new set of options at your fingertips. Once you've made blocks, organizing them on a page is as simple as dragging and dropping \u2014 no coding required to make custom workflows.\nWhether it\u2019s a roadmap for your engineering team or resources shared by your entire company, you\u2019ll be using blocks.\nCreating blocks and selecting block types\nText, images, audio, PDFs \u2014 they\u2019re all blocks you can insert into pages.",
            "Type / to quickly add content to any page (we call this the slash command). Let\u2019s say you want to create a to-do list of tasks your team needs to complete before a big launch. In the body of any Notion page type /todo and you\u2019ll get a checkbox. For a detailed list of block types, check out our reference material.\nHit / and you\u2019ll see clusters of block options you can scroll through and select. These include:\nBasic blocks \u2014 lay the groundwork for your page. With basic blocks, you can add text, headings, bullets, numbered lists, and other bits to help your content flow.",
            "In-line blocks \u2014 mention teammates, set dates or reminders, or reference other pages in your workspace. In-line blocks are great for collecting information, setting context, assigning deadlines, and keeping projects on track.\nMedia \u2014 whether it\u2019s images, video, code, audio, or more, media blocks bring together teams who might be using different tools to do their work. You can have a design mockup right next to the code that brings it to life on your website.\nEmbeds \u2014 tie valuable resources into your pages by embedding a Typeform, PDF, and more. For example, if you\u2019re creating a Contact Us page for your website, you can embed a Google Map of your company\u2019s address.",
            "Database \u2014 these are tables, boards, lists, and more. Database can be their own page, but they can also be in-line, meaning they're part of a page with other elements. Let\u2019s say you want to create a home page for your sales team with all the resources they need. If you have a database containing your open sales deals, you can create a Table - Inline database so those deals display on your team\u2019s home page, right next to resources like sales playbooks and messaging.",
            "Advanced blocks \u2014 include a table of contents, math equations, and other pre-formatted elements to your pages. For example, if you do weekly one-on-ones with your team, you can add a Template Button to a page. Once you create your template, all you have to do is add information specific to your latest check-in.\nIf you don\u2019t want to start from scratch, duplicate a copy of our remote one-on-one template to your workspace.\nBlocks make Notion completely customizable so your team can work exactly how they want. All the different types of blocks come together on any Notion page, spurring cross-functional collaboration for teams.\nCustomize your blocks",
            "After you\u2019ve added blocks, you can also customize them to make your pages unique. Hover your cursor to the left of any block until the \u22ee\u22ee icon appears. Then you can:\nMove existing blocks \u2014 rearrange and organize blocks on your pages based on your team\u2019s needs, like the pages in your wiki. Drag on the \u22ee\u22ee icon and drop wherever you\u2019d like.\nConvert blocks \u2014 change blocks containing text into a bulleted list, callout, and other simple blocks. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re creating a case study and want to emphasize a quote from your customer. From the \u22ee\u22ee icon to the left of any block, select Turn Into. Within the dropdown list, choose Quote to create a more stylized section for your key quote.",
            "Color text and backgrounds \u2014 emphasize parts of your content by adding color to text or a block\u2019s background. To do either on an existing block, click the \u22ee\u22ee icon to the left of the block. Then choose Color and pick away. For example, if you're building out customer support pages and want to highlight a specific frequently asked question, change up the background color of that block.\nIf you want a specific letter or word in a block to be a different color, highlight it. Then select A from the pop-up menu and choose from the color options.\nLearn about other styles and customization you can add to pages.\nExtend your block usage\nIf you\u2019re interested in using Notion for your team, you can use a plus plan trial, where you get free blocks to try it out.",
            "Once you reach your block storage limit, you can still read, edit, and organize existing content, but won't be able to add new blocks. You can delete existing blocks to free up storage.\nIf you or your team needs more than 1,000, upgrade your plan to get unlimited blocks.

You can even broaden the upvoting, allowing other teams across the organization to vote, leveraging their experience with users or potential customers.\nLog user feedback \u2014 Listening to what your users say can help you find ways to improve and solve problems.
